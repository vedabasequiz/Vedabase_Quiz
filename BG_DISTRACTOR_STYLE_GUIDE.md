# Bhagavad Gita Quiz Distractor Style Guide (Gold Standard)

## Purpose

To ensure every multiple-choice question tests real understanding of Srila Prabhupada's teachings, not pattern recognition, trivia elimination, or ideological labeling.

This guide defines what distractors must be, what they must avoid, and how they should function psychologically and philosophically.

---

## 1. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

**A good distractor must represent a plausible misunderstanding that a sincere reader of the Bhagavad Gita could realistically hold.**

**If a student can eliminate an option without knowing the Gita, the distractor has failed.**

---

## 2. Approved Distractor Categories (Use These)

Each incorrect option should fall into one of the following categories.
Every question should ideally include 2–3 different categories, not all the same.

### A. Partial Truth (Most Important Category)

**Definition:**
A statement that sounds correct, uses Gita language, but omits or distorts a crucial qualifier from the purport.

**Why it's powerful:**
This mirrors how misunderstanding actually happens.

**Example (BG 1):**
> "Compassion is always virtuous and should override duty."

**Why it works:**
- Compassion is virtuous — but without knowledge, it becomes sentimentality.

---

### B. Bodily Identification Trap

**Definition:**
Options that assume the self is the body, family, role, emotion, or social identity.

**Use especially in:** BG Chapters 1–3, 6, 13

**Example:**
> "Arjuna refuses to fight because harming family bodies is spiritually sinful."

**Why it works:**
- Sounds moral
- Misses the soul/body distinction emphasized by Prabhupada

---

### C. False Renunciation / Inaction-as-Spirituality

**Definition:**
Options that equate avoiding action with spiritual advancement.

**Use especially in:** BG Chapters 1–5, 18

**Example:**
> "Renouncing the battle proves Arjuna's spiritual maturity."

**Why it works:**
- Renunciation is valued in Vedic culture
- But Prabhupada explicitly warns against renunciation motivated by attachment

---

### D. Material Calculation Error

**Definition:**
Options that rely exclusively on material logic: numbers, strength, psychology, economics, or strategy.

**Use especially in:** BG Chapters 1, 2, 7, 10

**Example:**
> "Duryodhana accurately judged the battle based on army size."

**Why it works:**
- This is exactly how materialists think
- Misses divine agency (Krishna's presence)

---

### E. Moralism Without Transcendence

**Definition:**
Options that promote ethical behavior without reference to Krishna, soul, or dharma.

**Example:**
> "Avoiding violence is the highest moral principle regardless of circumstance."

**Why it works:**
- Appeals to modern ethics
- Contradicts Gita's dharmic framework

---

### F. Misapplied Scripture / Overgeneralization

**Definition:**
Correct Gita ideas applied in the wrong context.

**Example:**
> "Since the soul is eternal, actions have no moral consequence."

**Why it works:**
- Uses correct doctrine
- Draws an incorrect conclusion (Prabhupada warns against this)

---

## 3. Forbidden Distractor Types (DO NOT USE)

These are **Gold-standard violations**.

### ❌ A. Academic or Ideological Labels

**Never use:**
- determinist
- compatibilist
- libertarian
- rationalist
- progressivist
- legalist
- antinomian
- Docetic
- existentialist

**Why forbidden:**
- Not Vedabase language
- Tests terminology recognition, not understanding
- Breaks devotional tone

---

### ❌ B. Silly or Cartoon Distractors

**Examples to avoid:**
- "Religious tourism development"
- "Brand names of conchshells"
- "Because the gods were bored"

**Rule:**
If a sincere student would never consider the option, delete it.

---

### ❌ C. Absolutist Strawmen

**Avoid extreme claims like:**
- "All violence is always sinful"
- "Renunciation is always superior"
- "Material life is completely meaningless"

Prabhupada's teachings are discriminating, not simplistic.

---

### ❌ D. Vague or Unfalsifiable Statements

**Avoid:**
- "Because it felt right"
- "Due to many complex reasons"
- "It depends on perspective"

Each option must be clearly right or clearly wrong under Gita logic.

---

## 4. Structural Rules for Good Distractors

### Rule 1: One Clear Winner

- Only one option should fully align with verse + purport
- If two options seem defensible → revise

### Rule 2: Shared Vocabulary

- Use similar language level across all options
- Avoid making the correct answer sound "more spiritual" stylistically

**❌ Bad:**
> "Because Krishna's transcendental will supersedes all material calculations"
> vs
> "Because he was scared"

### Rule 3: No "Tone Giveaways"

**Avoid clues like:**
- obviously longer correct option
- obviously gentler or wiser tone
- extra Sanskrit only in correct choice

---

## 5. Difficulty Calibration by Distractor Type

| Difficulty | Distractor Mix |
|------------|----------------|
| **Easy** | 1 obvious wrong + 2 mildly plausible |
| **Medium** | 2 plausible + 1 partial truth |
| **Hard** | 2 partial truths + 1 deeply tempting false path |

**Adult quizzes should skew medium–hard, especially in the final 40%.**

---

## 6. Chapter-Sensitive Emphasis (BG-Specific)

| Chapter Range | Emphasize Distractors About |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| **BG 1** | Compassion, bodily attachment, false renunciation |
| **BG 2** | Misusing soul doctrine, emotional suppression |
| **BG 3** | Inaction, doership illusion |
| **BG 4** | Speculation vs disciplic succession |
| **BG 5** | Renunciation vs devotion |
| **BG 6** | Artificial meditation |
| **BG 7** | Impersonalism, partial surrender |
| **BG 10–11** | Krishna as symbol vs person |
| **BG 13** | Body vs knower confusion |
| **BG 18** | Avoiding duty under spiritual language |

---

## 7. Final Gold Check (Use Before Publishing)

Before approving a question, ask:

1. ✅ Could a sincere reader reasonably choose this wrong option?
2. ✅ Does this reflect a misunderstanding Prabhupada actually warns against?
3. ✅ Can the question be answered by tone alone? (If yes → fix)
4. ✅ Do the distractors teach, not just mislead?

**If all answers are yes, the distractors are Gold-standard.**
