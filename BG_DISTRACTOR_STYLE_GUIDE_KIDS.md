## Key Distractor Rules for Kids Quizzes

- No abstract ideas, negative or confusing phrasing
- Use concrete language and familiar ideas
- One obvious correct answer per question
- Avoid scary or moralizing tone
- No trick questions or double negatives
- Avoid 1-word distractors when possible
- Parallel phrasing preferred, but clarity always wins
