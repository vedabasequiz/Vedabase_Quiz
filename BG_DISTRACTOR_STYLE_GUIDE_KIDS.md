# Bhagavad Gita Quiz Distractor Style Guide — KIDS (Ages 8–12)

## Purpose

To test clear understanding, not confusion.
Kids' distractors should help them notice cause and effect, not wrestle with philosophy.

---

## 1. Core Principle (Kids Version)

**A good distractor for kids is something a child might honestly think after hearing the story once.**

**If it feels tricky or clever, it's wrong.**

---

## 2. Approved Distractor Categories (Kids)

Use 1–2 of these per question.

### A. Story Confusion

**Misremembering story details.**

**Example:**
> "Arjuna is scared because he forgot how to fight."

---

### B. Simple Emotion-Based Thinking

**Very natural for kids.**

**Example:**
> "Arjuna doesn't want to fight because fighting feels bad."

---

### C. Cause-and-Effect Mix-Up

**Wrong result from an action.**

**Example:**
> "If Arjuna doesn't fight, everyone will be happy."

---

### D. Overgeneralized Good/Bad Thinking

**Black-and-white reasoning.**

**Example:**
> "Good people never fight."

---

## 3. Forbidden Distractors (Kids)

### ❌ Abstract Ideas

**Never use:**
- soul/body philosophy
- renunciation
- illusion
- modes of nature

---

### ❌ Negative or Confusing Phrasing

**Avoid:**
- double negatives
- trick questions
- "Which is NOT…"

---

## 4. Structural Rules (Kids)

### Rule 1: Concrete Language Only

- Short sentences
- Everyday words
- Familiar ideas

### Rule 2: One Obvious Correct Answer

Distractors should be clearly wrong once the child understands the story

### Rule 3: Positive Framing

Avoid scary or moralizing tone

## 5. Difficulty Calibration (Kids)

| Difficulty | Distractor Style |
|------------|------------------|
| **Easy (first 60%)** | 1 obvious wrong + 1 story mix-up |
| **Later (last 40%)** | 1 emotional mistake + 1 cause-effect error |

**Never end on a confusing question.**

---

## 6. Chapter-Specific Emphasis (Kids)

| Chapter | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **BG 1** | Arjuna feels sad and confused |
| **BG 2** | Krishna teaches about the soul (very simple) |
| **BG 3** | Doing your duty |
| **BG 4** | Learning from a teacher |
| **BG 5** | Being calm and kind |
| **BG 6** | Controlling the mind |
| **BG 7** | Krishna is special |

## Kids Gold Check

**Ask:**

1. ✅ Would an 8–12 year old actually think this?
2. ✅ Is the wrong choice safe and non-confusing?
3. ✅ Does feedback explain gently in 1–2 sentences?

**If yes → Gold Kids Distractor**
