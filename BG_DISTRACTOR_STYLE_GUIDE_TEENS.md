# Bhagavad Gita Quiz Distractor Style Guide — TEENS (Ages 13–17)

## Purpose

To test understanding with guidance, not trickery—helping teens learn why certain ways of thinking are incomplete, while avoiding abstract metaphysics or academic framing.

---

## 1. Core Principle (Teen Version)

**A good distractor for teens represents a reasonable but incomplete thought a thoughtful teenager might actually have.**

**If the distractor feels childish or overly philosophical, it fails.**

---

## 2. Approved Distractor Categories (Teen-Appropriate)

Each question should use 2–3 of the following categories.

### A. Surface-Level Moral Reasoning

**Teen-friendly version of "partial truth."**

**Definition:**
Morally appealing but lacks spiritual depth.

**Example:**
> "Not fighting is good because hurting people is always wrong."

**Why it works:**
- Feels ethical
- Misses duty + soul understanding

---

### B. Emotion-Driven Thinking

**Very important for teens.**

**Definition:**
Decisions based on feelings rather than discrimination.

**Example:**
> "Arjuna should follow his heart because he feels bad about fighting."

---

### C. Oversimplified Spiritual Ideas

**Correct idea, oversimplified.**

**Example:**
> "Because the soul is eternal, what happens to the body doesn't matter at all."

**Why it works:**
- Uses real doctrine
- Draws a wrong conclusion

---

### D. Avoidance Disguised as Wisdom

**Teen-friendly false renunciation.**

**Example:**
> "Staying out of the battle proves Arjuna is spiritually mature."

---

### E. Peer-Logic / Social Reasoning

**Very realistic for teens.**

**Example:**
> "Arjuna should act like others expect him to, to avoid family conflict."

---

## 3. Forbidden Distractors (Teens)

### ❌ Academic or Abstract Language

**Never use:**
- determinism
- ontology
- epistemology
- metaphysics
- impersonal absolute

---

### ❌ Extreme or Unrealistic Claims

**Avoid:**
- "Krishna says emotions are bad"
- "The body doesn't matter at all"
- "Doing nothing is the best solution"

---

## 4. Structural Rules (Teens)

### Rule 1: One-Step Reasoning Only

Teen distractors should require **one reasoning step**, not multi-layer inference.

### Rule 2: Clear, Natural Language

- Short sentences
- No Sanskrit unless already explained in the question

### Rule 3: No Trick Wording

If a teen can answer correctly without understanding the verse, rewrite.

|------------|------------------|
| **Easy** | 1 clearly wrong + 2 realistic |

---

## 6. Chapter-Specific Emphasis (Teens)

| Chapter Range | Emphasize |
|---------------|-----------|
| **BG 1** | Feelings vs duty |
| **BG 2** | Misusing "soul" idea |
| **BG 3** | Avoiding responsibility |
| **BG 4** | Learning from teachers |
| **BG 5** | Confusing peace with inactivity |
| **BG 6** | Unrealistic meditation |
| **BG 7** | Thinking God is distant or symbolic |

---

## Teen Gold Check

**Ask:**

1. ✅ Would a thoughtful teen choose this?
2. ✅ Does the wrong option teach something after feedback?
3. ✅ Is the mistake emotional, social, or simplified—not abstract?

**If yes → Gold Teen Distractor**
