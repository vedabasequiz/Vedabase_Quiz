---

## Issues Found

### Kids - Chapter 1

#### Q4: "When Arjuna sees his friends and family in the other army, how does he feel?"
**Current Distractors:**
- "Very happy and excited" ✓ Plausible
- "Angry and ready to fight" ✓ Plausible  
- **"Bored and sleepy"** ✗ Absurd/silly - obviously wrong

**Recommendation:** Replace with "Confident and ready to lead" (reflects misconception that duty should make you eager)

---

#### Q5: "What happens to Arjuna's body when he is very sad and confused?"
**Current Distractors:**
- "It becomes very strong" ✓ Reasonable
- "It feels hot and sweaty" ✓ Plausible physical response
- **"It falls asleep"** ✗ Too literal/silly - doesn't fit context

**Recommendation:** Replace with "He feels energized and ready to fight" (reflects misconception that clarity/duty should make body stronger)

---

#### Q6: "What does Arjuna think about fighting his own family members?"
**Current Distractors:**
- "It will make him a great hero" ✓ Plausible misunderstanding
- "It is good and he will be happy" ✓ Reflects false reasoning
- **"It doesn't matter"** ✗ Too vague/weak - not a real misconception

**Recommendation:** Replace with "It will give him wealth and power to rule the kingdom" (reflects material attachment reasoning)

---

#### Q7: "When families are broken and lose their good ways, what happens?"
**Current Distractors:**
- "They become richer and happier" ✓ Plausible false belief
- "They become wiser and stronger" ✓ Reflects misconception
- **"They move to a new place"** ✗ Non-sequitur - irrelevant

**Recommendation:** Replace with "They enjoy more freedom without old restrictions" (reflects modern misconception about tradition)

---

#### Q10: "At the end of Chapter 1, what is Arjuna's condition?"
**Current Distractors:**
- "He is excited and ready to fight" ✓ Good opposite
- "He stands with his weapons ready" ✓ Plausible
- **"He runs away from the battle"** ✗ While technically possible, it's too obvious he doesn't (he sits down)

**Recommendation:** Either keep as-is OR replace with "He remains steady and focused on his duty" (more nuanced misconception)

---

### Teens - Chapter 1

#### Q2: "Why does Duryodhana approach Dronacarya in BG 1.2?"
**Current Distractors:**
- "To seek blessings" ✓ Plausible
- "To boast confidently about his army" ✓ Reasonable 
- **"To receive final military instructions"** - This is somewhat plausible but less obviously wrong than in kids version

**Recommendation:** Could be stronger. Replace with "To convince Drona to join his side instead" (reflects misunderstanding of loyalty)

---

### Kids - Chapter 2

#### Q3: "What does Arjuna do in BG 2.7?"
**Current Distractors:**
- "He tells Krsna to go away" ✓ Good opposite
- "He gets angry with Krsna" ✓ Plausible reaction
- **"He ignores everything Krsna says"** - Reasonable but could be more elegant

**Recommendation:** Replace with "He argues and refuses to listen to Krsna" (subtle but reflects resistance to teaching)
