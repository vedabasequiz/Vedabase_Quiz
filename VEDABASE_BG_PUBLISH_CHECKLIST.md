Essential template for BG 8, 12, 18. High false-path density (q2, q7, q10, q15, q17, q19, q21), balanced translation/purport reasoning, natural difficulty progression (structure → discipline/psychology → happiness/culmination), psychological pedagogy without dilution, no devotional shortcuts, strong thematic continuity with Ch5 non-doership and inner happiness themes.

**BG Chapter 7 (Adult)** ✅ PUBLISH-READY: Knowledge of the Absolute - LOCKED GOLD STANDARD after comprehensive 10-phase refinement journey (36% purport, 9/25; 319 chars avg feedback, 84% length balance). Journey highlights: Condensed verbose feedback 54% (700→319 avg, 820→293 median), fixed critical content errors (q10: BG 7.7→7.10, q15: generic→four types), eliminated answer position exploit (22@B→9/6/5/5 balanced distribution), achieved full Tier 1/2/3 compliance (ASCII-only, verdict labels, verse consistency, adult depth 3-5 sentences). Demonstrates systematic transformation methodology: audit→condense→fix exploits→polish→technical compliance. Contains 4 strategic "Why this matters" sections (q1, q14, q22, q25), synthesis question (q22) connecting maya's divine nature to surrender necessity, sophisticated distractors in finale (q24: mayavadi conception, q25: yoga-maya coverage).

Feedback enhancement: 13 questions expanded from thin 1-sentence feedback to Adult depth 2-5 sentences with "Why this matters" sections, contrastive analysis, false-path warnings. Length balance: 10 questions systematically fixed. URL corrected: q23 (8.29 → 8.28, Ch8 has only 28 verses). New synthesis: q24 connects BG 8.5-7 and 8.14 on death consciousness, q25 synthesizes cosmic time cycles with devotional superiority. Demonstrates complete transformation methodology: critical error detection → systematic enhancement → iterative validation → publish-ready status.
