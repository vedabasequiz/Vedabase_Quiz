⚖️ TIER 2 — STRONG CONSTRAINTS

Plausible

7. Translation vs Purport Balance

☐ Overall mix respects locked ratio:

~60–65% translation-anchored

~35–40% purport-critical

False paths

Psychological traps

Misinterpretations warned against by Srila Prabhupada

8. Difficulty Progression

10. UX & Labeling

☐ Question numbering correct (no duplicates)

🎨 TIER 3 — GOLD-STANDARD REFINEMENT

These protect excellence, depth, and long-term quality.

11. Question Craft

☐ Language is precise and uncluttered

☐ No safe, purely definitional overuse

☐ Questions provoke reflection, not memorization

Partial truths

Misplaced emphasis

Common devotional misunderstandings

☐ Distractors do not accidentally become correct under loose reading

13. Feedback Depth (Adults)

☐ 3–5 sentences where needed

☐ Optional “Why this matters” included for key questions

☐ Consequences of misunderstanding briefly highlighted

14. End-of-Chapter Finish

☐ Quiz ends on:

Insight

Caution

Integration

☐ Avoid ending on trivial or purely factual questions

15. Overall Flow

☐ Questions feel coherent as a sequence

☐ No abrupt tonal shifts

☐ The quiz feels like a guided study session, not a test

🔐 Exception Clause (Important)

Mechanical or labeling errors (e.g., verdict text, missing tags, minor formatting) may be corrected without regenerating questions, provided source integrity, logic, and structure remain unchanged.

This prevents unnecessary regeneration while preserving rigor.
