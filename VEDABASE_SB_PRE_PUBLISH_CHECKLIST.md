Srimad Bhagavatam (SB)
Question Quality & Pre-Publish Checklist

Failing any Tier-1 item = DO NOT PUBLISH

🔒 TIER 1 — HARD RULES (Non-Negotiable)

Source & Integrity

☐ Vedabase.io only (Srila Prabhupada translation + purports)

☐ No interpretive paraphrasing that contradicts purport intent

☐ No modern psychology, comparative religion, or external philosophy overlays

☐ Narrative facts align with the actual verse flow (not assumed knowledge)

Structure & Counts

☐ Correct audience & question count

Adults: 25

Teens: 15

Kids: 10

☐ Questions follow chapter flow (no late-chapter ideas introduced early)

☐ Difficulty progression respected (first ~60% easier, last ~40% harder)

☐ End section includes synthesis / danger-awareness questions

Website & Format

☐ Website-ready ASCII JSON only

☐ Proper IDs, slugs, verse labels, and URLs

☐ Feedback uses Correct / Review (never "Wrong")

☐ Every question includes a direct Vedabase verse link in feedback

⚖️ TIER 2 — STRONG CONSTRAINTS (Must Fix Before Publish)

Epistemology Coverage (SB-Specific)

☐ At least 20–25% of questions test how knowledge is received

☐ Explicit contrast between:

Hearing vs speculation

Authority vs independence

☐ At least 3 questions warn against wrong approaches to scripture

Fail condition:
SB quiz reads like narrative trivia without epistemological training.

Narrative Anchoring

☐ Speaker, listener, and setting are treated as meaningful, not decorative

☐ Questions test why the narration occurs, not just what happened

☐ No character-name recall without purpose

Purport Reasoning & False-Path Detection

☐ 6–7 Adult questions explicitly require purport reasoning

☐ Plausible but rejected mindsets included as distractors

☐ At least one Kali-yuga distortion tested per quiz

☐ Distractors represent tempting misreadings, not silly errors

Bhakti Supremacy Framing

☐ Dharma, jnana, karma are framed as incomplete without bhakti

☐ No neutral pluralism ("many paths equally valid")

☐ Supremacy of bhakti is shown through reasoning, not slogans

Feedback Quality (Age-Locked)

☐ Adults: 3–5 sentences, contrastive, purport-aligned

☐ Teens: 2–3 sentences, guided reasoning

☐ Kids: 1–2 short, concrete sentences

☐ No shaming language; use consequence-aware explanation

☐ Optional "Why this matters" included in 3–5 Adult questions

🎨 TIER 3 — GOLD-STANDARD REFINEMENT (Excellence, Not Blocking)

Question Craft

☐ Prompts are precise and non-leading

☐ Only one clearly correct answer

☐ Distractors fail for philosophical reasons, not wording tricks

☐ Language is sober, not devotional fluff or academic abstraction

End-of-Chapter Synthesis

☐ Final 10–15% of questions integrate:

Authority

Hearing

Bhakti

Danger of deviation

☐ At least one question asks what must be accepted

☐ At least one question asks what must be rejected

☐ Ending leaves the student oriented, not merely informed

Kali-Yuga Realism

☐ Human weakness acknowledged

☐ Mercy-based process emphasized

☐ Overconfidence subtly challenged

☐ The student is trained to be humble but not passive
