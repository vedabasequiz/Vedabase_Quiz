Why this matters: Recognizing how envy disguises itself as diplomacy protects us from similar duplicity in our own dealings. The false path here is assuming all formal respect is genuine when it may conceal resentment. Understanding this helps us see through superficial piety that masks deeper antagonism.",

Why this matters: Understanding that transcendental variety is eternal protects us from the false path of impersonalism, which wrongly concludes that the Absolute must be formless and without variety.

Why this matters: Many reject spiritual inquiry during personal crisis, thinking they must resolve problems first.
