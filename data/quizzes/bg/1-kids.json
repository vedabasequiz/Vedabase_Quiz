      "feedback": "Dhritarastra is blind in two ways - his eyes cannot see, and his love for his sons prevents him from seeing what is spiritually right. Sometimes loving someone too much can make us forget what is good and bad.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Arjuna's pity comes from thinking his relatives are just their bodies. But everyone is really an eternal soul inside a body. When we only think of bodies and forget souls, we get confused about what is truly right.",
