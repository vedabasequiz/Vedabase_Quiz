      "feedback": "Dhritarastra asks about what his sons and the Pandavas are doing after assembling for battle. His anxious question reveals his attachment and concern for his dynasty. The term 'dharma-ksetra' (place of dharma) in his question ironically foreshadows the ultimate victory of righteousness.",

      "feedback": "Duryodhana mentions many formidable warriors including his teacher Drona, the grandsire Bhisma, and the mighty Karna. This massive assembly of great fighters creates the dramatic tension of the battle. Yet despite this seemingly invincible array, Krsna's presence with the Pandavas ensures their ultimate victory.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada reveals Duryodhana's psychological manipulation: his diplomatic words mask an accusation. By praising the Pandavas' military arrangement, he subtly blames Dronacarya for training them so well. This shows how envy disguises itself as diplomacy. Understanding these subtle forms of envy helps us avoid them in our own lives and recognize them in others.",

      "feedback": "Krsna blows His conchshell Pancajanya, and Arjuna blows Devadatta, producing transcendent sounds that shatter the hearts of Dhritarastra's sons.

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada explains that Arjuna's pity arises from identifying the soul with the body, a foundational spiritual mistake. This bodily attachment clouds wisdom and prevents him from acting in the soul's best interest. True compassion considers the eternal nature of the soul. When we understand the soul's transcendental position, our compassion becomes spiritually mature rather than sentimentally misguided.",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada clearly states that Arjuna is bewildered by illusion on account of material affection for his family members. The inauspicious omens Arjuna perceives are subjective manifestations of his confused mental state. Material attachment distorts our perception of reality.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada reveals the subtle trap: Arjuna speaks of renouncing kingdom and pleasures, which sounds spiritual, but his motivation is material attachment to relatives' bodies. True renunciation means acting without attachment to results while fulfilling one's duty, not avoiding duty due to emotional attachment. Many people confuse running away from responsibility with spiritual renunciation.",

        "Arjuna correctly understands that all killing is always equally sinful"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Arjuna's fear of sin arises from material attachment to relatives' bodies, not spiritual wisdom. When acting under Krsna's direction in one's prescribed duty, there is no sin. This teaches us that morality must be understood in relation to transcendental duty, not just material sentiment.",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "When families stop performing proper ceremonies and respecting tradition (kula-dharma), the ancestors no longer receive honor and remembrance through shraddha rituals and offerings.
