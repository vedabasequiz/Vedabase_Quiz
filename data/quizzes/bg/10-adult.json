The synthesis: the sacred and secular divide collapses when one sees Krishna's spark in all splendor. Why this matters: The false path is thinking matter is separate from spirit or that appreciation of beauty is material. Real Krishna consciousness sees all excellence as emanating from the Supreme, using material manifestations to remember and glorify the source rather than reject them as illusion.",

      "prompt": "How does Chapter 10's extensive description of Krishna's opulences support the conclusion that bhakti-yoga surpasses all other paths?",
      "choices": [
        "It shows that understanding manifestations intellectually produces complete liberation without devotion to Krishna",
        "It proves that material opulence and spiritual advancement are completely unrelated in every way",
        "It demonstrates that recognizing Krishna as source of all excellence naturally leads to worship and devotion",
        "It establishes that studying manifestations is more important than direct Krishna consciousness and service"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "The synthesis: Krishna reveals His opulences to inspire devotion, not for academic study. Seeing Krishna's excellence everywhere - from the sun's brilliance to the mind's consciousness - naturally produces wonder and worship. The chapter's pedagogical arc moves from establishing Krishna's supremacy through manifestations to the conclusion that one fragment of Him sustains everything. Why this matters: The false path is remaining in intellectual appreciation of opulence. Real understanding transforms knowledge into devotion, using perception of Krishna's glory throughout creation as constant reminder to engage in loving service to the Supreme Person who is the source of all magnificence.",
