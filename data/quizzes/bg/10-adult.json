      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada explains that anything extraordinarily opulent, beautiful, or glorious - whether in spiritual or material world - should be considered Krishna's opulence. The synthesis: the sacred and secular divide collapses when one sees Krishna's spark in all splendor. Why this matters: The false path is thinking matter is separate from spirit or that appreciation of beauty is material. Real Krishna consciousness sees all excellence as emanating from the Supreme, using material manifestations to remember and glorify the source rather than reject them as illusion.",

      "feedback": "The synthesis: Krishna reveals His opulences to inspire devotion, not for academic study. Seeing Krishna's excellence everywhere - from the sun's brilliance to the mind's consciousness - naturally produces wonder and worship. The chapter's pedagogical arc moves from establishing Krishna's supremacy through manifestations to the conclusion that one fragment of Him sustains everything. Why this matters: The false path is remaining in intellectual appreciation of opulence. Real understanding transforms knowledge into devotion, using perception of Krishna's glory throughout creation as constant reminder to engage in loving service to the Supreme Person who is the source of all magnificence.",
