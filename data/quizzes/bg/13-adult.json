The body cannot see, hear, or think without the presence of the soul. Confusing the field (body) with the knower (soul) is the root of material bondage.

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Chapter 13 prescribes both analytical discrimination and devotional engagement. Why this matters: Krishna doesn't present knowledge or devotion in isolation but integrated practice. Understanding prakriti and purusha philosophically creates the foundation; applying this understanding through devotional service achieves the goal. This prevents two false paths: dry jnana without bhakti, and sentimental bhakti without jnana. Real advancement requires both head and heart aligned toward Krishna.",

      "choices": [
        "Knowledge of matter and spirit are separate topics unrelated to devotional practice",
        "Discriminating field from knower through devotional consciousness leads to Krishna realization",
        "Understanding the field intellectually is sufficient without devotional actual transformation",
        "Devotional service eliminates need for philosophical understanding of prakriti and purusha"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Chapter 13 synthesizes epistemology and devotion as inseparable. Why this matters: Prabhupada presents knowledge and devotion as complementary, not contradictory. Philosophical discrimination between matter and spirit (jnana) creates the foundation; unwavering devotional service (bhakti) actualizes liberation. One cannot truly know the field without recognizing Krishna as its source. One cannot know the knower without understanding it as Krishna's fragmental part. And one cannot know Krishna without devotional engagement. The chapter integrates analysis, discrimination, and love. This demolishes both dry intellectualism and sentimental anti-intellectualism. Perfect knowledge culminates in devotion; perfect devotion includes knowledge.",
