      "prompt": "How do Chapter 15's teachings about the inverted tree (15.1-4), eternal soul fragments (15.7), and Supreme Person beyond all (15.17-18) work together to guide spiritual practice?",
      "choices": [
        "The tree metaphor suggests nature worship; soul fragments indicate pantheism; Supreme Person is abstract principle",
        "Understanding material world as tree enables detachment; recognizing souls as parts reveals relationship knowing Purushottama produces devotion",
        "They present contradictory philosophies requiring personal choice between impersonal tree, individual souls, or personal God",
        "Tree represents material science; soul fragments justify individualism; Supreme Person symbolizes collective human consciousness"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Chapter 15 integrates: (1) Cosmology-material world as inverted tree rooted in spirit, requiring detachment through knowledge of dependency; (2) Ontology-souls as eternal Krishna fragments, establishing relationship not independence; (3) Theology-Purushottama transcending matter and spirit, worthy of complete devotion. The synthesis: knowing world's structure (tree) frees from illusion; understanding soul's nature (fragment) reveals constitutional position; recognizing Krishna's supremacy (Purushottama) produces total engagement. The trap: treating these as separate topics. Real realization integrates: detachment from temporary (tree), identity as dependent part (fragment), devotion to transcendent whole (Supreme Person). Liberation requires all three-cosmological knowledge, ontological understanding, theological devotion converging in Krishna consciousness.",
