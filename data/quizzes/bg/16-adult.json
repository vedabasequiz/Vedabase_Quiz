The trap: thinking one alone suffices. Why this matters: Simply avoiding lust/anger/greed creates void; simply attempting fearlessness/self-control/charity while harboring three gates fails-they must work together. Successful transformation requires simultaneously abandoning demoniac tendencies while actively developing divine qualities through devotional practice.",
