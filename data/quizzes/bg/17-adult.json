        "That shraddha-less sacrifice-charity-austerity still accumulates some spiritual merit easily",
        "That actions without faith in Krishna are asat bringing no benefit",
        "That mechanical performance of duty generates karma-phala in svarga (heaven) eventually",
        "That faithless yajna-dana-tapas purify consciousness through habitual repetition alone"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada emphasizes shraddha-virahitam (without faith) action is asat (not eternal), naiveha (not here), na pretya (not hereafter)-bears no lasting fruit. The trap: thinking religious actions accumulate merit automatically. Why this matters: The false path is faithless ritual. Real benefit requires shraddha directed toward param brahma-ritualistic performance without devotional consciousness is asat (temporary), produces no transcendent result. Faith connects action to eternal; faithlessness keeps action material.",

      "choices": [
        "It teaches abstract philosophy without practical application to daily choices",
        "It maps guna-quality across faith, food, sacrifice, austerity, charity for self-assessment",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Chapter 17 is operational manual-provides guna-mapping for assessing every aspect of spiritual life. Before eating: sattvic, rajasic, tamasic? Before charity: proper recipient, time, place? Before worship: sattvic deity or rajasic demigod? This framework enables moment-by-moment discrimination. Real spiritual life is conscious choice based on knowledge; unconscious drift follows conditioning. This teaching empowers deliberate cultivation of sattva-guna systematically through informed daily decisions.",

Om Tat Sat dedication transforms sattvic action into bhakti-directing worship, austerity, charity toward Absolute not just elevated material platform.

(2) Ahara (food) reinforces that guna-sattvic food supports sattvic consciousness. (3) Yajna (sacrifice) channels energy-sattvic yajna purifies accumulated karma. (4) Tapas (austerity) disciplines body-mind-speech-sattvic tapas builds spiritual strength. (5) Dana (charity) distributes resources-sattvic dana advances dharma. These aren't isolated but synergistic: sattvic faith -> sattvic food -> capacity for sattvic yajna -> strength for sattvic tapas -> discrimination for sattvic dana. Result: systematic cultivation of sattva-guna. Final step: Om Tat Sat dedication transcends sattva toward nirguna-bhakti-pure devotion beyond material nature.",
