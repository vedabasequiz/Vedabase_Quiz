Real tyaga: Fully engage in prescribed duties WITH detachment from fruits-action level remains robust, desire level drops to zero. It's psychological transformation not behavioral reduction. Cannot achieve tyaga through doing less but through desiring less WHILE acting fully.

Why this matters: The false path is naive voluntarism-believing one can instantly perform sattvic action while consciousness remains rajasic/tamasic.

Brahmanas (intellectual-priestly), kshatriyas (administrative-martial), vaishyas (economic-productive), shudras (service-labor)-each has prescribed duties suited to svabhava (inherent nature). The trap: thinking one path fits all or duties are arbitrary social constructs. Why this matters: The false path is dharma-relativism-rejecting varnashrama as cultural accident rather than psychological-spiritual necessity. Real understanding: Different natures require different sadhanas-intellectual types need jnana-emphasis, active types need karma-emphasis. Cannot impose uniform path ignoring svabhava. Therefore find one's actual guna-determined nature, perform corresponding dharma with bhakti-this is personalized spirituality respecting psycho-physical reality, not forcing artificial uniformity.",

Why this matters: The false path is dharma-shopping-abandoning actual duties pursuing exotic practices. Real sadhana: Accept current position as Krishna's arrangement-purify consciousness THERE through bhakti. Brahmana shouldn't envy kshatriya action; grhastha shouldn't artificially adopt sannyasa. Better sva-dharma imperfectly performed than para-dharma (another's duty) perfectly imitated-authenticity matters more than prestige. Therefore work through actual nature-position toward transcendence, not abandon reality for fantasy. Perfection comes through transformed consciousness in one's actual dharma, not through adopted roles.",

The trap: mistaking brahma-bhuta for perfection. Why this matters: The false path is impersonal finality-achieving brahma-nirvana (liberation from material identification) then stopping, considering devotion sentimental. Real understanding: Brahma-bhuta is platform FROM WHICH bhakti begins-18.54 continues 'mad-bhaktim labhate param' (attains supreme devotion to Me). Impersonal liberation clears ground; bhakti is actual cultivation. Cannot bypass devotion claiming Brahman-realization suffices-that's incomplete understanding stopping at nirvishesha (formless) missing supreme personal aspect.

The trap: thinking jnana or karma alone sufficient for Krishna-realization.

The trap: partial surrender maintaining independence in some life areas. Why this matters: The false path is compartmentalized spirituality-'Krishna for spiritual matters, I decide everything else.' Real sharanagati (surrender): sarva-bhavena means total-every thought-word-action oriented to Krishna. Not partial delegation but complete dependence.

(3) INTEGRATION: Varnashrama-dharma (41-48) provides personalized sadhana respecting svabhava-each person's duty suited to nature. (4) TRANSCENDENCE: Brahma-bhuta state (54) transcends gunas but isn't final-leads to para-bhakti (supreme devotion). (5) CULMINATION: Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja (18.66)-abandon all varieties of dharma, surrender to Me alone-Krishna guarantees mokshayishyami (I shall liberate) from all papa (sin). Arc: Threefold analysis elevates through sattva; brahma-bhuta transcends gunas; but perfection comes through complete surrender to Krishna-bhakti subsumes and completes all yoga paths. Final teaching: Not impersonal merging or renunciation but personal devotional surrender to Supreme Person-this is Gita's conclusion integrating karma-jnana-bhakti into unified sadhana culminating in Krishna-prapti (attaining Krishna) in eternal Goloka-dhama.",
