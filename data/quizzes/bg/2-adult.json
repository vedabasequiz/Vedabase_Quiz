      "prompt": "In the purport to BG 2.1, what does Srila Prabhupada say about Arjuna's compassion?",
      "choices": [
        "Material compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless",
        "Compassion for relatives demonstrates spiritual evolution beyond ordinary consciousness",
        "All compassion reflects transcendental awareness regardless of its object",
        "Bodily compassion becomes spiritual when motivated by sincere family affection"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada explains that compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization, while compassion for the gross material body is senseless-like saving a drowning man by rescuing only his clothes. Arjuna's compassion targets the wrong object (relatives' bodies), producing confusion rather than clarity. Why this matters: Material sentimentality masquerades as transcendental mercy when we focus on the body's temporary distress while neglecting the soul's eternal welfare.",

      "prompt": "In BG 2.2, what does Krishna say about Arjuna's impurities (kasmalam)?",
      "choices": [
        "They reflect natural human sensitivity requiring gentle understanding",
        "They lead not to higher planets but to infamy",
        "They demonstrate evolved moral reasoning about protecting life",
        "They reveal spiritual advancement through compassionate discernment"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna calls Arjuna's weakness kasmalam, not befitting an Aryan, and warns it leads to infamy, not higher elevation. He treats it as contamination that covers duty, not as a virtue. This shows that sentimental softness can be a disguise for bodily illusion.",

      "choices": [
        "They represent both his enemies and those worthy of worship",
        "They are worthy of worship, so fighting them is never permissible",
        "They are weaker than him but demand false respect",
        "They have betrayed their duty as warriors in this conflict"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct: Bhisma and Drona oppose Arjuna yet remain worshipable, creating a duty dilemma. Respect does not automatically cancel prescribed duty when elders support adharma. Arjuna must learn to honor persons while not endorsing their present side.",

      "choices": [
        "He asks Krsna for advice but keeps final decision",
        "He surrenders as a disciple and asks for instruction",

        "He treats Krsna as equal friend not spiritual master"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Arjuna surrenders as a disciple and asks Krishna to instruct him. This is a shift from taking advice to accepting authority. Without surrender, Krishna's teaching would remain optional rather than decisive.",

      "choices": [
        "Grief for material loss shows sensitivity when grounded in philosophical awareness",
        "The wise lament neither the living nor dead, recognizing soul eternality",
        "Mourning the soul's temporary material bondage indicates proper spiritual understanding",
        "Compassionate sorrow for suffering bodies reflects evolved transcendental consciousness"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada explains that lamentation for material bodies-living or dead-indicates ignorance of the soul's eternal nature (pandita sama-darshina). The wise neither lament the living nor the dead because they recognize the soul beyond bodily modifications. Material sentiment (attachment to bodies) differs categorically from spiritual wisdom (vision of soul).",

      "choices": [
        "There was a time when we did not exist",
        "Never was there a time when I did not exist",
        "Individuality is temporary illusion that will end after liberation",
        "All beings merge into one existence in the future"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna says there was never a time when He, Arjuna, or the kings did not exist, nor will any cease to be. The verse establishes eternal individuality across past, present, and future. Why this matters: This directly rejects the idea that persons become ultimately undifferentiated; eternal relationship with Krishna remains meaningful.",

      "prompt": "How does BG 2.13 illustrate the soul's continuity through bodily changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Like consciousness evolving through progressive stages of awareness",
        "As embodied soul passes from boyhood to youth to age",
        "Through gradual spiritual awakening from material ignorance to self-knowledge",
        "As identity transforms from bodily identification to transcendental realization"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The same dehi passes from boyhood to youth to old age while the body changes. This everyday continuity supports the next step: death is another change of body, not the end of the self. Therefore grief based on bodily change is misplaced.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.13",

      "prompt": "In BG 2.14, why are happiness and distress compared to winter and summer?",
      "choices": [
        "Because material existence follows inevitable karmic patterns beyond our control",
        "Temporary sensations come and go like seasons; endure them",
        "To show suffering and pleasure alternate in predictable karmic cycles",
        "Because both experiences equally contribute to progressive spiritual maturation"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Happiness and distress arise from sense contact and come and go like seasons. Knowing they are temporary supports tolerance rather than panic or craving. Equanimity flows from clear perception, not forced numbness.",

      "id": "bg2-q9",
      "prompt": "According to BG 2.15, who is eligible for liberation?",
      "choices": [
        "One who responds naturally to pleasure and pain with appropriate emotions",
        "One steady and not disturbed by happiness or distress",
        "One who maintains detachment while pursuing prescribed material duties",
        "One who transcends bodily needs through complete withdrawal from action"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The dhira who is not disturbed by happiness and distress becomes fit for liberation. Qualification is about steadiness of consciousness, not perfect external conditions. Spiritual life is practiced now, amid dualities.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.15",

      "prompt": "In BG 2.31, what does Krishna say a kshatriya should consider regarding a righteous fight?",
      "choices": [
        "Warfare should be avoided to prevent karmic entanglement",
        "Nothing is higher for a kshatriya than a righteous fight",
        "Fighting family members creates insurmountable spiritual obstacles",
        "Battle requires complete detachment before righteous engagement"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: For a kshatriya, nothing is higher than a righteous fight. Duty performed without material attachment is not a fall-down but a righteous engagement. Therefore avoiding one's prescribed dharma out of sentiment is not spiritual advancement.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.31",

      "prompt": "In the purport to BG 2.20, what does Srila Prabhupada explain as the symptom of the soul's presence?",
      "choices": [
        "Life energy pervading the body produces observable warmth and vitality",
        "Consciousness spread throughout the body like sunlight from the sun",
        "Coordinated biological functions indicate an organizing life principle within",
        "Rational thought and self-awareness distinguish conscious beings from matter"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Consciousness is the symptom of the soul, like sunshine indicates the sun. It is not a product of matter but evidence of the living self within the body. When consciousness is absent, the soul has departed.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.20",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/20/",

      "id": "bg2-q12",
      "prompt": "How does the garment analogy in BG 2.22 refute the fear of death?",
      "choices": [
        "Death brings complete annihilation of existence and identity",
        "It shows the soul remains unchanged while bodies are exchanged",
        "Individual identity ceases when the soul merges into the supreme",
        "Consciousness ceases when the body dies since both are interdependent"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: As a person discards old clothes and accepts new ones, the soul changes bodies. The self remains the same while the outer covering is replaced. This reframes death as transition, not annihilation.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.22",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/22/",
      "verdict": "Correct"

      "id": "bg2-q13",
      "prompt": "Why does BG 2.25 emphasize the soul as invisible, inconceivable and immutable?",
      "choices": [
        "Material observation provides the only reliable path to understanding reality",
        "To show the soul transcends material perception and speculation",
        "Invisible phenomena require empirical verification before philosophical acceptance",
        "Immutability indicates the soul's nature as unchanging eternal energy"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The soul is described as invisible, inconceivable, and immutable, beyond material measurement. Because it does not change, bodily events cannot touch it. Realization requires hearing from shabda-pramana, not only sense-based proof.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.25",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/25/",
      "verdict": "Correct"

    {
      "id": "bg2-q14",
      "prompt": "In BG 2.30, why need one not grieve for any living being?",
      "choices": [
        "Grief honors the departed and demonstrates proper emotional sensitivity",
        "Because he who dwells in the body can not be slain",
        "Rebirth into another body makes death a temporary transition only",
        "Material suffering lacks ultimate reality, making lamentation illusory"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The indwelling self cannot be slain, so lamentation has no ultimate basis. The body can be destroyed, but the soul is unaffected. This ends grief at the root, not merely by offering consolation.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.30",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/30/",

      "prompt": "According to BG 2.47, what is the proper relationship between work and its results?",
      "choices": [
        "One has right to fruits if work is done properly",
        "One has right to perform duty but not to fruits",
        "One should avoid work entirely to prevent attachment to results",
        "One should work only when results are guaranteed to be favorable"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: One has the right to perform prescribed duty, but not to the fruits. Why this matters: When results become the motive, anxiety and attachment enter and duty becomes a transaction. Karma-yoga means acting as an offering and leaving outcomes to Krishna.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.47",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/47/",
      "verdict": "Correct"

      "id": "bg2-q16",
      "prompt": "In BG 2.49, how does Krishna characterize work done for fruitive results compared to buddhi-yoga?",
      "choices": [
        "Fruitive work can be offered to Krishna later for purification",
        "Abominable activities should be kept far distant by devotional service",
        "Planning one's work intelligently demonstrates buddhi-yoga in practice",
        "Desiring fruits from work is natural and spiritually neutral"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna calls fruitive work inferior and tells Arjuna to keep it far away by buddhi-yoga. Desire for results binds one to anxiety and exploitation mentality. Buddhi-yoga is a different aim: duty as offering, not transaction.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.49",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/49/",
      "verdict": "Correct"

      "id": "bg2-q17",
      "prompt": "According to BG 2.55, what characterizes one in pure transcendental consciousness (sthita-prajna)?",
      "choices": [
        "One who moderates all sense desires through strict disciplined regulation",
        "One who gives up all sense desires, satisfied in the self alone",
        "One who fulfills all desires systematically to achieve final detachment",
        "One who analyzes desires philosophically before acting on them selectively"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The sthita-prajna gives up sense-gratificatory desires and is satisfied in the self. This is not suppression but a higher satisfaction replacing lower cravings. Krishna consciousness reduces desire by higher taste.",

      "prompt": "How do the arguments about the soul's eternality (BG 2.12-25) and Arjuna's warrior duty (BG 2.31-32) work together to resolve his crisis?",
      "choices": [
        "Both reveal duty transcends personal comfort; act despite difficulty",
        "Eternal soul makes death illusory; kshatriya duty makes fighting righteous",
        "They contradict each other revealing inconsistency in teaching",
        "Either fighting or fleeing would be acceptable since all choices are relative"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Soul eternality removes the fear of 'killing the self,' and kshatriya-dharma clarifies that fighting here is righteous duty. Together they remove both philosophical objection and practical hesitation. This is how knowledge becomes fearless action.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.12-32",

      "choices": [
        "Forcefully suppressing all emotional reactions creates true spiritual detachment",
        "Recognizing impermanence of sense experience enables balanced action in duties",
        "Work outcomes are predetermined by fate so they don't actually matter",
        "Experiencing material pleasures helps one advance spiritually through gradual satisfaction"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Seeing dualities as temporary (2.14-15) supports yoga-stha action (2.48). Insight into impermanence makes outcomes less gripping, enabling steady duty. Equanimity is born from knowledge, not forced stoicism.",

      "prompt": "In the purport to BG 2.7, what false path does Srila Prabhupada warn against regarding family attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Families naturally protect each other from death eternally",
        "Family attachment is based on 'skin disease' mentality",
        "Only humans can be affectionate to relatives and family",
        "Society can definitely save one from death through collective effort"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Prabhupada calls family attachment a 'skin disease' when it is treated as ultimate shelter. Why this matters: Family duty remains, but family cannot save one from death or give final security. Use family life as a field of service, not as the soul's refuge.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Correct: The krpana wastes the human form by quitting life without self-realization, like cats and dogs. Human life is meant for atma-jnana, not only bodily maintenance. To ignore that purpose is the real miserliness.",

        "His refusal demonstrates spiritual maturity transcending violence",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna warns that refusing to fight will bring sin and loss of reputation. Neglect of prescribed duty is not transcendence, even if justified with 'compassion.' A sentimental motive does not cancel dharmic accountability.",

      "prompt": "In the purport to BG 2.13, why does Srila Prabhupada say the Mayavadi theory of oneness cannot be entertained?",
      "choices": [
        "Because individuality is only a temporary illusion during material existence",
        "Because cutting the Supreme into fragmental souls would make Him changeable",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,

      "correctIndex": 1,

        "Soul and bodily action operate in completely separate realms with no connection",
        "Soul-body distinction enables duty performance without existential investment in outcomes",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: If the body is like clothing, bodily outcomes do not touch the real self. That insight supports fighting and working without attachment to results (2.38, 2.47). Knowledge turns action into duty and offering rather than egoic grasping.",
