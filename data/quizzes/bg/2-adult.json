      "choices": [
        "Material compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless",
        "Compassion for relatives demonstrates spiritual evolution beyond ordinary consciousness",
        "All compassion reflects transcendental awareness regardless of its object",
        "Bodily compassion becomes spiritual when motivated by sincere family affection"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada explains that compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization, while compassion for the gross material body is senseless-like saving a drowning man by rescuing only his clothes. Arjuna's compassion targets the wrong object (relatives' bodies), producing confusion rather than clarity. Why this matters: Material sentimentality masquerades as transcendental mercy when we focus on the body's temporary distress while neglecting the soul's eternal welfare.",

      "prompt": "In BG 2.2, what does Krishna say about Arjuna's impurities (kasmalam)?",
      "choices": [
        "They reflect natural human sensitivity requiring gentle understanding",
        "They lead not to higher planets but to infamy",
        "They demonstrate evolved moral reasoning about protecting life",
        "They reveal spiritual advancement through compassionate discernment"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna calls Arjuna's weakness kasmalam, not befitting an Aryan, and warns it leads to infamy, not higher elevation. He treats it as contamination that covers duty, not as a virtue. This shows that sentimental softness can be a disguise for bodily illusion.",

        "They represent both his enemies and those worthy of worship",
        "They are worthy of worship, so fighting them is never permissible",
        "They are weaker than him but demand false respect",
        "They have betrayed their duty as warriors in this conflict"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct: Bhisma and Drona oppose Arjuna yet remain worshipable, creating a duty dilemma. Respect does not automatically cancel prescribed duty when elders support adharma. Arjuna must learn to honor persons while not endorsing their present side.",

        "He treats Krsna as equal friend not spiritual master"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Arjuna surrenders as a disciple and asks Krishna to instruct him. This is a shift from taking advice to accepting authority. Without surrender, Krishna's teaching would remain optional rather than decisive.",

        "The wise lament neither the living nor dead, recognizing soul eternality",

        "Compassionate sorrow for suffering bodies reflects evolved transcendental consciousness"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada explains that lamentation for material bodies-living or dead-indicates ignorance of the soul's eternal nature (pandita sama-darshina). The wise neither lament the living nor the dead because they recognize the soul beyond bodily modifications. Material sentiment (attachment to bodies) differs categorically from spiritual wisdom (vision of soul).",

        "All beings merge into one existence in the future"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna declares 'na tv evaham jatu nasam'-never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor these kings; nor shall any cease to be. Why this matters: The verse explicitly establishes eternal individuality (aham, tvam, ime) refuting both Buddhist momentariness and Mayavada merging. Personal eternal relationship with Krishna is sanatana-dharma's foundation-not achieving undifferentiated oneness but perfecting loving service to the eternally distinct Lord.",

        "As embodied soul passes from boyhood to youth to age",
        "Through gradual spiritual awakening from material ignorance to self-knowledge",
        "As identity transforms from bodily identification to transcendental realization"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The same dehi passes from boyhood to youth to old age while the body changes. This everyday continuity supports the next step: death is another change of body, not the end of the self. Therefore grief based on bodily change is misplaced.",

      "prompt": "In BG 2.14, why are happiness and distress compared to winter and summer?",
      "choices": [
        "Because material existence follows inevitable karmic patterns beyond our control",
        "Temporary sensations come and go like seasons; endure them",
        "To show suffering and pleasure alternate in predictable karmic cycles",
        "Because both experiences equally contribute to progressive spiritual maturation"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Happiness and distress arise from sense contact and come and go like seasons. Knowing they are temporary supports tolerance rather than panic or craving. Equanimity flows from clear perception, not forced numbness.",

      "choices": [
        "One who responds naturally to pleasure and pain with appropriate emotions",
        "One steady and not disturbed by happiness or distress",
        "One who maintains detachment while pursuing prescribed material duties",
        "One who transcends bodily needs through complete withdrawal from action"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The dhira who is not disturbed by happiness and distress becomes fit for liberation. Qualification is about steadiness of consciousness, not perfect external conditions. Spiritual life is practiced now, amid dualities.",

      "id": "bg2-q10",
      "prompt": "In BG 2.31, what does Krishna say a kshatriya should consider regarding a righteous fight?",
      "choices": [
        "Warfare should be avoided to prevent karmic entanglement",
        "Nothing is higher for a kshatriya than a righteous fight",
        "Fighting family members creates insurmountable spiritual obstacles",
        "Battle requires complete detachment before righteous engagement"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna declares that for a kshatriya, nothing is higher than dharmyad yuddhad (righteous war)-this isn't concession but affirmation of varna-dharma's validity. Fighting in accordance with prescribed duty isn't spiritually neutral but positively righteous when performed without material attachment. This establishes that renouncing one's dharma isn't spiritual advancement but dereliction disguised as transcendence.",

      "choices": [
        "Life energy pervading the body produces observable warmth and vitality",
        "Consciousness spread throughout the body like sunlight from the sun",
        "Coordinated biological functions indicate an organizing life principle within",
        "Rational thought and self-awareness distinguish conscious beings from matter"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Consciousness is the symptom of the soul, like sunshine indicates the sun. It is not a product of matter but evidence of the living self within the body. When consciousness is absent, the soul has departed.",

      "prompt": "How does the garment analogy in BG 2.22 refute the fear of death?",
      "choices": [
        "Death brings complete annihilation of existence and identity",
        "It shows the soul remains unchanged while bodies are exchanged",
        "Individual identity ceases when the soul merges into the supreme",
        "Consciousness ceases when the body dies since both are interdependent"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: As a person discards old clothes and accepts new ones, the soul changes bodies. The self remains the same while the outer covering is replaced. This reframes death as transition, not annihilation.",

      "prompt": "Why does BG 2.25 emphasize the soul as invisible, inconceivable and immutable?",
      "choices": [
        "Material observation provides the only reliable path to understanding reality",
        "To show the soul transcends material perception and speculation",
        "Invisible phenomena require empirical verification before philosophical acceptance",
        "Immutability indicates the soul's nature as unchanging eternal energy"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The soul is described as invisible, inconceivable, and immutable, beyond material measurement. Because it does not change, bodily events cannot touch it. Realization requires hearing from shabda-pramana, not only sense-based proof.",

      "choices": [
        "Grief honors the departed and demonstrates proper emotional sensitivity",
        "Because he who dwells in the body can not be slain",
        "Rebirth into another body makes death a temporary transition only",
        "Material suffering lacks ultimate reality, making lamentation illusory"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The indwelling self cannot be slain, so lamentation has no ultimate basis. The body can be destroyed, but the soul is unaffected. This ends grief at the root, not merely by offering consolation.",

      "choices": [
        "One has right to fruits if work is done properly",
        "One has right to perform duty but not to fruits",
        "One should avoid work entirely to prevent attachment to results",
        "One should work only when results are guaranteed to be favorable"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The verse establishes adhikara (right) to karmani (prescribed work) but not to phaleshu (fruits)-a revolutionary principle separating action from result. Why this matters: Results-driven action means performing duty contingent on guaranteed outcomes, producing anxiety and attachment. Right to action exists unconditionally; right to results doesn't exist at all-results belong to Krishna's arrangement. Perform duty as offering regardless of result, transforming work from selfish transaction to selfless service.",

      "prompt": "In BG 2.49, how does Krishna characterize work done for fruitive results compared to buddhi-yoga?",
      "choices": [
        "Fruitive work can be offered to Krishna later for purification",
        "Abominable activities should be kept far distant by devotional service",
        "Planning one's work intelligently demonstrates buddhi-yoga in practice",
        "Desiring fruits from work is natural and spiritually neutral"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna calls fruitive work inferior and tells Arjuna to keep it far away by buddhi-yoga. Desire for results binds one to anxiety and exploitation mentality. Buddhi-yoga is a different aim: duty as offering, not transaction.",
      "verseLabel": "BG 2.49",

        "One who moderates all sense desires through strict disciplined regulation",
        "One who gives up all sense desires, satisfied in the self alone",

        "One who analyzes desires philosophically before acting on them selectively"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The sthita-prajna gives up sense-gratificatory desires and is satisfied in the self. This is not suppression but a higher satisfaction replacing lower cravings. Krishna consciousness reduces desire by higher taste.",

        "Both reveal duty transcends personal comfort; act despite difficulty",
        "Eternal soul makes death illusory; kshatriya duty makes fighting righteous",
        "They contradict each other revealing inconsistency in teaching",
        "Either fighting or fleeing would be acceptable since all choices are relative"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Chapter 2's teaching synthesizes metaphysics with ethics-soul eternality (2.12-25) removes the fear of killing, while kshatriya-dharma (2.31-32) establishes fighting as righteous duty. This two-pronged approach transforms paralysis into action: metaphysical knowledge dissolves false compassion; ethical duty provides positive direction. Together they enable fearless engagement in prescribed responsibility.",

      "choices": [
        "Forcefully suppressing all emotional reactions creates true spiritual detachment",
        "Recognizing impermanence of sense experience enables balanced action in duties",
        "Work outcomes are predetermined by fate so they don't actually matter",
        "Experiencing material pleasures helps one advance spiritually through gradual satisfaction"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Seeing dualities as temporary (2.14-15) supports yoga-stha action (2.48). Insight into impermanence makes outcomes less gripping, enabling steady duty. Equanimity is born from knowledge, not forced stoicism.",

        "Society can definitely save one from death through collective effort"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Prabhupada calls family attachment a 'skin disease' when it is treated as ultimate shelter. Why this matters: Family duty remains, but family cannot save one from death or give final security. Use family life as a field of service, not as the soul's refuge.",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Correct: The krpana (miser) quits life without solving the human form's purpose-like cats and dogs dying without self-realization. Human life's value lies in potential for self-realization; squandering this through material pursuit alone constitutes ultimate miserliness. Cats and dogs cannot inquire about transcendence; humans who don't are voluntarily reducing themselves to animal consciousness.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna warns that refusing this dharmic duty will result in papa (sin) and akirtim (loss of reputation)-not spiritual credit but moral failure. Abandoning prescribed duty isn't transcendence but transgression, regardless of how compassionate the rationalization sounds. This establishes that duty-neglect carries karmic consequences even when motivated by apparently noble sentiment.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada refutes the Mayavada 'cutting' theory-if souls were cut from the Supreme, He would become changeable, contradicting His immutability. Fragmental portions (vibhinnamshas) exist eternally as individuals-not produced by division but constitutionally distinct. Acintya-bhedabheda (inconceivable oneness-difference) resolves what emanation cannot: simultaneous relationship and distinction without compromising either party's nature.",
