      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Compassion for eternal soul is self-realization; compassion for gross material body is senseless-like saving drowning man by rescuing only his clothes. The trap: assuming all compassion equally spiritual. Why this matters: The false path is material sentimentality mistaken for transcendental mercy-focusing on body's temporary distress while neglecting soul's eternal welfare. Real understanding: Genuine kripa (mercy) addresses soul's bondage to birth-death cycle, not body's temporary comfort. Arjuna's compassion targets wrong object (relatives' bodies) producing moha not clarity. This demonstrates how sentiment without tattva-jnana creates spiritual-sounding rationalizations for adharma. Therefore discriminate between material emotion (attachment-based) and spiritual compassion (knowledge-based) before claiming ethical superiority.",

      "feedback": "Krishna criticizes Arjuna's lamentation as kasmalam (impurities) not befitting Aryan-deviation from kshatriya duty leads not to higher planets but to infamy (akirtim). The trap: romanticizing compassionate-sounding sentiments. Why this matters: The false path is assuming soft emotions indicate spiritual refinement when actually revealing bodily consciousness. Real understanding: Krishna's critique is surgical-impurities aren't sins requiring atonement but contaminations obscuring natural dharma-sense. Kshatriya instinct for righteous combat exists; attachment covers it. This establishes that spiritual advancement sometimes appears harsh (criticizing apparent compassion) because sentiment masquerading as ethics must be exposed. Therefore Krishna's uncompromising response models guru's role-removing illusion even when disciple attached to confusion.",

The trap: assuming respect always prevents opposition. Why this matters: The false path is sentimental ethics-believing reverence for persons trumps transcendental duty. Real understanding: Dharma sometimes requires opposing respected persons when they support adharma-Bhisma/Drona fight for Kauravas despite recognizing Pandavas' righteousness. Their position doesn't change their worship-worthiness but also doesn't absolve Arjuna's duty. This demonstrates how relationships and duty operate on different planes-can honor someone as guru while opposing their current action.

The trap: spiritual shopping without surrender. Why this matters: The false path is approaching guru as consultant not master-wanting wisdom but retaining autonomy to accept/reject. Real understanding: Arjuna models complete shelter-'I am Your disciple, soul surrendered unto You; please instruct me.' This represents qualitative shift from friendship-based dialogue to guru-disciple relationship requiring submission. Without this surrender, Krishna's subsequent teachings would remain theoretical options rather than authoritative direction. Therefore spiritual progress requires prapatti (surrender) not intellectual sampling-must accept guru's verdict even when challenging personal preferences.",

The trap: emotional attachment demonstrates spiritual sensitivity. Why this matters: The false path is mistaking material compassion for self-realization-grieving bodily changes while ignoring soul's continuity. Real understanding: Wise neither lament living nor dead because recognizing soul beyond bodily modifications. Material sentiment (attachment to bodies) differs categorically from spiritual wisdom (vision of soul). Arjuna's grief, though appearing philosophically sophisticated, stems from deha-abhimana not jnana. This establishes Ch2's foundation-until transcending bodily identification, cannot discriminate truly. Therefore test wisdom not by emotional depth but by transcendental discrimination.",

Why this matters: The false path is assuming individuality (aham, tvam, ime-I, you, these) represents temporary illusion ending in absorption-Mayavada misinterpretation. Real understanding: Verse explicitly establishes eternal individuality-past/present/future all include distinct persons. Krishna specifies Himself, Arjuna, and kings separately across all time. This refutes both Buddhist momentariness (we didn't exist before) and Mayavada merging (won't exist distinctly after). Therefore personal eternal relationship with Krishna is sanatana-dharma's foundation-not achieving undifferentiated oneness but perfecting loving service to eternally distinct Lord.",

Why this matters: The false path is missing continuity-assuming each life-stage represents different self, producing existential discontinuity. Real understanding: One continuous observer experiences bodily transformations without being transformed-'I was child, I am adult, I will be old.' This establishes soul as distinct from body through empirical observation not mere philosophy. Tatha dehantara-praptih (similarly obtaining another body) extends principle beyond one lifetime-death is just another transformation like puberty. Therefore grief for death betrays same ignorance as grief for aging-mistaking body's changes for self's changes.",

The trap: treating dualities as ultimately real. Why this matters: The false path is reactivity-allowing temporary sensations to determine consciousness state, producing material bondage through attachment/aversion. Real understanding: Seasonal analogy reveals dualities' inherent impermanence-winter inevitably becomes summer becomes winter. Fighting this cycle wastes energy; endurance allows transcendence. This isn't stoic suppression but metaphysical insight-recognizing temporary nature removes power to disturb. Tolerance flows from understanding, not willpower. Therefore spiritual equanimity requires grasping material existence's oscillatory nature, not developing emotional numbness.",

Why this matters: The false path is circumstance-dependence-waiting for favorable external conditions before spiritual practice, producing perpetual postponement. Real understanding: Eligibility determined not by situation but by consciousness-ability to remain undisturbed regardless of externals. This inverts common assumption-liberation doesn't come after achieving comfort but through equanimity amid discomfort. Dhira (sober person) possesses this steadiness now, not after material problems solved. Therefore stop waiting for perfect conditions-develop equipoise amid current circumstances, transforming spiritual life from future goal to present practice.",

The trap: ontological relativism. Why this matters: The false path is treating body-soul as equally real but different-missing categorical distinction between temporary and eternal. Real understanding: Body doesn't transition from existence to nonexistence (birth to death)-rather participates in nonexistence throughout, being perpetually changing. Soul doesn't exist temporarily then cease-participates in eternality throughout. This resolves Arjuna's grief by exposing category error-lamenting change in what's inherently changeable while ignoring unchanging observer. Therefore death affects only ever-changing (body) never eternal (soul)-removes lamentation's philosophical basis.",

The trap: materialism-consciousness as brain function. Why this matters: The false path is emergent-property theory-consciousness arising from matter's complexity, requiring no immaterial soul. Real understanding: Srila Prabhupada establishes consciousness as lakshana (symptom) not product-effect indicating cause without being reducible to cause. Sun's light doesn't constitute sun but infallibly indicates it; consciousness doesn't constitute soul but infallibly indicates it. Where consciousness, there soul-where no consciousness, soul absent.

Why this matters: The false path is identity-confusion-clothing analogy reveals self remains unaffected by body-change as person unaffected by wardrobe-change. Real understanding: Just as no one grieves discarding old clothes for new, shouldn't grieve discarding old body for new. Death isn't self's termination but self's relocation. This naturalizes reincarnation-as normal as changing outfits. Grief for death thus resembles grief for changing clothes-category confusion between wearer and worn.

The trap: empiricism-only measurable things exist. Why this matters: The false path is positivism-demanding soul fit within material epistemology's constraints, requiring sensory/intellectual verification. Real understanding: Soul's transcendental nature means escapes material detection methods by definition-invisibility indicates spiritual not material substance, inconceivability shows beyond mental categories, immutability establishes unchanging reality beneath changing phenomena. These qualities render grief philosophically invalid-if soul transcends material perception, bodily death (material event) cannot affect it.

Why this matters: The false path is 'don't grieve because soul gets new body'-misses deeper point that soul fundamentally unslayable. Real understanding: Grief unnecessary not because rebirth compensates for death but because death cannot touch soul's essential nature. This is ontological impossibility not cyclical consolation. Reincarnation describes what happens; soul's indestructibility explains why lamentation is category error. Killing body doesn't injure soul any more than destroying car injures driver-incompatible categories.

Real understanding: Right to action exists unconditionally; right to results doesn't exist at all-results belong to Krishna's arrangement not our control. This frees from dual bondage: attachment to performing (when success expected) and attachment to not-performing (when failure feared).

Real understanding: Fruit-seeking isn't spiritually neutral but spiritually poisonous-creates karpanya (miserliness) treating Krishna's energy as personal resource for exploitation. Buddhi-yoga (devotional service) represents qualitative alternative not quantitative refinement-different orientation entirely, not just less intensity.

Real understanding: Sthita-prajna doesn't suppress desires but transcends them-satisfaction shifts from external objects to internal realization. In Krishna consciousness desires subside automatically without extraneous effort-higher taste dissolves lower attachment.

Why this matters: The false path is forced emotional suppression-attempting equanimity through psychological discipline alone, producing brittle detachment requiring constant vigilance. Real understanding: Recognizing dualities' inherent temporality (agamapayino'nitya) removes their power to disturb-consciousness freed not through suppression but through understanding. Equanimity flows from insight not effort-seeing winter-summer pattern makes their alternation non-threatening.

The trap: family as spiritual foundation. Why this matters: The false path is sentimentalized domesticity-treating family relationships as spiritually ultimate, providing existential security and permanent satisfaction. Real understanding: Family affection based on shared 'skin' (bodily similarity) represents material consciousness masquerading as love-temporary association mistaken for eternal bond. Cannot protect from death because death is body's destiny not soul's problem-misplaced faith in material relationships for spiritual security. This doesn't negate family dharma but corrects its ontological status-relative duty not absolute refuge. Therefore maintain family responsibilities while recognizing only Krishna provides actual protection-family as service-field not security-source.",

Why this matters: The false path is wasting human opportunity-living for eating/sleeping/mating/defending like animals, failing to address atma-jnana (self-knowledge) unique to human platform. Real understanding: Human life's value lies in potential for self-realization-squandering this through material pursuit alone constitutes ultimate miserliness, hoarding body's energy while bankrupting soul's chance. Cats/dogs cannot inquire about transcendence; humans who don't are voluntarily reducing themselves to animal consciousness. This establishes urgency-not infinite births to waste, must utilize human facility. Therefore prioritize atma-tattva inquiry-temporary comfort available in any species, spiritual liberation only in human form.",

Why this matters: The false path is biological reductionism-treating prana (vital air), blood, or nervous system as self's basis, remaining within material framework. Real understanding: Soul transcends all biological functions-prana circulates because soul present, not vice versa. Consciousness indicates soul like temperature indicates fire-symptomatic effect proving immaterial cause. Where consciousness, there soul; where no consciousness, soul departed. This provides direct verification method-empirically detecting transcendental reality through its material symptom. Therefore soul-theory isn't mere speculation but has observational basis-presence/absence of consciousness empirically distinguishes living from dead.",

Why this matters: The false path is emanation philosophy treating souls as Supreme's transformations-requires God undergo change (becoming many from one), destroying Absolute concept. Real understanding: Fragmental portions (vibhinnamshas) exist eternally as individuals-not produced by division but constitutionally distinct. Supreme remains unchanged while souls remain eternal-both immutable but in different categories (infinite vs infinitesimal). This preserves both God's unchangeability and soul's eternality without Mayavada's metaphysical impossibility. Therefore acintya-bhedabheda (inconceivable oneness-difference) resolves what emanation cannot-simultaneous relationship and distinction without compromising either party's nature.",

Real understanding: Relationship isn't expert teaching novice (quantitative difference) but Supreme instructing conditioned (qualitative difference). Krishna's superiority is constitutional not circumstantial-never deluded, eternally conscious. Arjuna's inferiority is present condition not permanent nature-forgetful but recoverable. This establishes teaching's possibility-Supreme can enlighten conditioned through knowledge-transmission. Without hierarchical distinction, teaching becomes meaningless exchange between equals.

Perform kshatriya duty appropriate for current body without confusion that results touch soul. Detachment roots in correct identification not emotional suppression.
