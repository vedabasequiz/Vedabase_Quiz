      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada explains that compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization, while compassion for the gross material body is senseless-like saving a drowning man by rescuing only his clothes. Arjuna's compassion targets the wrong object (relatives' bodies), producing confusion rather than clarity. Why this matters: Material sentimentality masquerades as transcendental mercy when we focus on the body's temporary distress while neglecting the soul's eternal welfare. Genuine mercy addresses the soul's bondage to the birth-death cycle, not bodily comfort. Discriminate between material emotion (attachment-based) and spiritual compassion (knowledge-based).",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna criticizes Arjuna's lamentation as kasmalam (impurities) not befitting an Aryan-deviation from kshatriya duty leads not to higher planets but to infamy. Krishna's critique is surgical: impurities aren't sins requiring atonement but contaminations obscuring natural dharma-sense. Spiritual advancement sometimes appears harsh because sentiment masquerading as ethics must be exposed. Krishna's uncompromising response models the guru's role-removing illusion even when the disciple is attached to confusion.",

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct: Bhisma and Drona stand as opponents yet remain worthy of worship (pujarhau)-creating a dharma-sankat (duty-dilemma) between prescribed duty and natural respect. Dharma sometimes requires opposing respected persons when they support adharma. Relationships and duty operate on different planes-one can honor someone as guru while opposing their current action. Personal affection cannot override transcendental obligation determined by shastra-vidhi.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Arjuna surrenders as sisya (disciple) requesting instruction, abandoning half-measures like seeking advice while retaining decision-control. He models complete shelter: 'I am Your disciple, soul surrendered unto You; please instruct me.' This represents a qualitative shift from friendship-based dialogue to guru-disciple relationship requiring submission. Without this surrender, Krishna's subsequent teachings would remain theoretical options rather than authoritative direction.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada explains that lamentation for material bodies-living or dead-indicates ignorance of the soul's eternal nature (pandita sama-darshina). The wise neither lament the living nor the dead because they recognize the soul beyond bodily modifications. Why this matters: Mistaking material compassion for self-realization means grieving bodily changes while ignoring the soul's continuity. Material sentiment (attachment to bodies) differs categorically from spiritual wisdom (vision of soul). Test wisdom not by emotional depth but by transcendental discrimination.",

      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna declares 'na tv evaham jatu nasam'-never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor these kings; nor shall any cease to be. The verse explicitly establishes eternal individuality: past, present, and future all include distinct persons. This refutes both Buddhist momentariness (we didn't exist before) and Mayavada merging (won't exist distinctly after). Personal eternal relationship with Krishna is sanatana-dharma's foundation-not achieving undifferentiated oneness but perfecting loving service to the eternally distinct Lord.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The embodied soul (dehi) passes from kaumaram (boyhood) to yauvanam (youth) to jara (old age)-the same soul changing bodies. One continuous observer experiences bodily transformations without being transformed: 'I was a child, I am an adult, I will be old.' Tatha dehantara-praptih (similarly obtaining another body) extends this principle beyond one lifetime-death is just another transformation like puberty. Grief for death betrays the same ignorance as grief for aging-mistaking the body's changes for the self's changes.",

        "To demonstrate that both states are equally valuable for spiritual growth"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Happiness and distress are compared to sheeta-ushna (winter-summer)-temporary sense-contact sensations that are agamapayino'nitya (come-go, impermanent), requiring titiksha (tolerance). The seasonal analogy reveals dualities' inherent impermanence: winter inevitably becomes summer becomes winter. Recognizing this temporary nature removes their power to disturb-tolerance flows from understanding, not willpower. Spiritual equanimity requires grasping material existence's oscillatory nature, not developing emotional numbness.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: One who is sama-duhkha-sukham (steady amid distress-happiness) qualifies for amrtatvaya (immortality/liberation). Eligibility is determined not by situation but by consciousness-the ability to remain undisturbed regardless of externals. Liberation doesn't come after achieving comfort but through equanimity amid discomfort. The dhira (sober person) possesses this steadiness now, not after material problems are solved.",

        "Both body and soul eventually merge into one undifferentiated spiritual existence",
        "Since the body is temporary and soul eternal, death changes nothing real",

        "Neither the soul nor the body can be known with any real certainty"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The verse distinguishes asat (nonexistent body) from sat (existent soul)-asat na vidyate bhava (nonexistent has no endurance), sat na vidyate abhava (existent has no cessation). Why this matters: Treating body and soul as equally real but different misses the categorical distinction between temporary and eternal. The body participates in nonexistence throughout, being perpetually changing; the soul participates in eternality throughout. This resolves Arjuna's grief by exposing a category error: lamenting change in what's inherently changeable while ignoring the unchanging observer.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Consciousness is a symptom of the soul-like sunlight indicates the sun's presence even when clouds hide it, consciousness indicates the soul's presence in the body. Srila Prabhupada establishes consciousness as lakshana (symptom) not product: an effect indicating a cause without being reducible to that cause. Where consciousness exists, the soul is present; where no consciousness, the soul is absent. This provides empirical verification of the soul's presence through its symptomatic effect.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The soul changing bodies is compared to a person changing clothes-vasamsi jirnani (worn garments) are discarded for navani (new ones). Just as no one grieves discarding old clothes for new, one shouldn't grieve discarding an old body for a new one. Death isn't the self's termination but the self's relocation. Transcend bodily identification by recognizing the self as eternal inhabitant, not temporary dwelling-this transforms death from tragedy to transition.",

        "The soul is merely a temporary combination of material elements",
        "What cannot be seen or touched must not truly exist"

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The soul is described as avyakta (invisible), acintya (inconceivable), and avikary (immutable)-transcending material perception and speculation categories. The soul's transcendental nature means it escapes material detection methods by definition: invisibility indicates spiritual substance, inconceivability shows it's beyond mental categories, immutability establishes unchanging reality beneath changing phenomena. These qualities render grief philosophically invalid-if the soul transcends material perception, bodily death (a material event) cannot affect it. Spiritual realization requires transcending empiricist assumptions and accepting reality beyond sense-perception through shabda-pramana.",

      "prompt": "In BG 2.30, why need one not grieve for any living being?",
      "choices": [
        "Because grieving shows devotion and humility toward those who leave",
        "Because he who dwells in the body can not be slain",
        "Because the soul will be reborn anyway, so grief is unnecessary",
        "Because suffering is only imagination, so grief is pointless"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The verse states that the dehi (indwelling self) na hanyate (cannot be slain)-removing lamentation's basis absolutely. Grief is unnecessary not because rebirth compensates for death but because death cannot touch the soul's essential nature-this is an ontological impossibility, not cyclical consolation. Killing the body doesn't injure the soul any more than destroying a car injures the driver. Soul-indestructibility dissolves grief completely, while rebirth-logic (still a material framework) merely postpones it.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: The verse establishes adhikara (right) to karmani (prescribed work) but not to phaleshu (fruits)-a revolutionary principle separating action from result. Why this matters: Results-driven action means performing duty contingent on guaranteed outcomes, producing anxiety and attachment. Right to action exists unconditionally; right to results doesn't exist at all-results belong to Krishna's arrangement, not our control. This frees us from dual bondage: attachment to performing (when success is expected) and attachment to not-performing (when failure is feared).

      "feedback": "Correct: Krishna calls fruitive work avaram karma (abominable activity) to be kept durena (far distant) through buddhi-yoga-extraordinarily strong language. Fruit-seeking isn't spiritually neutral but spiritually poisonous-it creates karpanya (miserliness), treating Krishna's energy as a personal resource for exploitation. Buddhi-yoga (devotional service) represents a qualitative alternative, not quantitative refinement-a different orientation entirely, not just less intensity.

The sthita-prajna doesn't suppress desires but transcends them-satisfaction shifts from external objects to internal realization. In Krishna consciousness, desires subside automatically without extraneous effort-higher taste dissolves lower attachment.

The soul's indestructibility removes the philosophical objection (can't truly kill anyone), while kshatriya-dharma provides positive justification (righteous war for righteous warrior). Together they eliminate paralysis: Arjuna no longer fears action's consequences (metaphysical security) while having clear direction to act (ethical imperative).

Recognizing dualities' inherent temporality (agamapayino'nitya) removes their power to disturb-consciousness is freed through understanding, not suppression.

Why this matters: Sentimentalized domesticity treats family relationships as spiritually ultimate, providing existential security and permanent satisfaction, but family affection based on shared 'skin' represents material consciousness masquerading as love. Family cannot protect from death because death is the body's destiny, not the soul's problem.

Why this matters: Wasting human opportunity means living for eating, sleeping, mating, and defending like animals, failing to address atma-jnana (self-knowledge) unique to the human platform. Human life's value lies in the potential for self-realization-squandering this through material pursuit alone constitutes ultimate miserliness. Cats and dogs cannot inquire about transcendence; humans who don't are voluntarily reducing themselves to animal consciousness.

The soul transcends all biological functions: prana circulates because the soul is present, not vice versa. Consciousness indicates the soul like temperature indicates fire-a symptomatic effect proving an immaterial cause. Where consciousness exists, the soul is present; where no consciousness, the soul has departed.",

      "choices": [
        "Because individuality is only a temporary illusion during material existence",
        "Because cutting the Supreme into fragmental souls would make Him changeable",

      "feedback": "Correct: Srila Prabhupada refutes the Mayavada 'cutting' theory-if souls were cut from the Supreme, He would become changeable, contradicting His immutability. Fragmental portions (vibhinnamshas) exist eternally as individuals-not produced by division but constitutionally distinct. The Supreme remains unchanged while souls remain eternal-both immutable but in different categories (infinite vs infinitesimal). Acintya-bhedabheda (inconceivable oneness-difference) resolves what emanation cannot: simultaneous relationship and distinction without compromising either party's nature.",

      "feedback": "Correct: The Krishna-Arjuna instructor-instructed relationship is meaningful because Krishna is Supreme while Arjuna is bhramita (forgetful soul deluded by maya). The relationship isn't expert teaching novice (quantitative difference) but Supreme instructing conditioned (qualitative difference). Krishna's superiority is constitutional, not circumstantial-never deluded, eternally conscious; Arjuna's inferiority is present condition, not permanent nature-forgetful but recoverable. This establishes the teaching's possibility: the Supreme can enlighten the conditioned through knowledge-transmission.",

Soul-body distinction enables duty performance without existential investment: if bodies are mere garments, bodily outcomes (victory/defeat) don't affect the essential self. Perform kshatriya duty appropriate for the current body without confusion that results touch the soul. Metaphysical knowledge serves a practical purpose-transforming action from self-interested grasping to self-aware offering.",
