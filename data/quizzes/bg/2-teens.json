        "He should have run away earlier from the battlefield and escaped"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krsna tells Arjuna that he is acting weakly and unmanly despite being a warrior, and should overcome this weakness. Sometimes compassion based on bodily identification must be overcome.",

      "choices": [
        "Understanding the sunshine represents Brahman realization which is lower stage",
        "Knowing the sun's surface represents Paramatma realization which is intermediate",
        "Entering the sun planet represents Bhagavan realization which is highest",
        "All three are equal according to impersonal philosophy taught by Mayavadis"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "The bhaktas who realize Bhagavan are topmost transcendentalists, like those who enter the sun planet. Personal realization of God is higher than impersonal realization. This challenges the false idea that all paths and realizations are equal.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada distinguishes material weakness from spiritual humility. Arjuna's depression stems from bodily attachment, not soul consciousness. True spiritual humility means surrendering to Krsna's will while performing duty, not emotional breakdown. This challenges the false idea that all compassion is spiritual.",

      "feedback": "The krpana does not solve life's problems as a human should and quits like cats and dogs without self-realization.

      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada refutes the Mayavadi conclusion that individual souls lose their identity at liberation. The Gita's teachings presume individual existence continuing after liberation. Impersonalism is a misunderstanding, not ultimate truth.

      "feedback": "The Gita explicitly states that Krsna, Arjuna, and all beings existed as individuals in the past, exist now, and will continue as individuals in the future.
