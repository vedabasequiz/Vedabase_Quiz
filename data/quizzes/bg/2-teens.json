      "choices": [
        "His military strategy is weak and will lead directly to defeat",
        "He is showing weakness and sadness even though he is a warrior",
        "His weapons are not strong enough for this particular difficult battle",
        "He should have run away earlier from the battlefield and escaped"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krsna tells Arjuna that he is acting weakly and unmanly despite being a warrior, and should overcome this weakness. Sometimes compassion based on bodily identification must be overcome.",

      "prompt": "In the purport to BG 2.2, Srila Prabhupada explains three realizations of Absolute Truth using the sun analogy. Which realization represents the highest?",
      "choices": [
        "Understanding the sunshine represents Brahman realization which is lower stage",
        "Knowing the sun's surface represents Paramatma realization which is intermediate",
        "Entering the sun planet represents Bhagavan realization which is highest",
        "All three are equal according to impersonal philosophy taught by Mayavadis"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "The bhaktas who realize Bhagavan are topmost transcendentalists, like those who enter the sun planet. Personal realization of God is higher than impersonal realization. This challenges the false idea that all paths and realizations are equal.",

      "choices": [
        "Arjuna's compassion represents genuine spiritual realization and advancement as explained here",
        "Weakness arising from material attachment is different from spiritual humility",
        "All forms of compassion are equally valuable spiritually speaking",
        "Arjuna demonstrates perfect understanding of transcendental duty at all"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada distinguishes material weakness from spiritual humility. Arjuna's depression stems from bodily attachment, not soul consciousness. True spiritual humility means surrendering to Krsna's will while performing duty, not emotional breakdown. This challenges the false idea that all compassion is spiritual.",

        "The impersonal conclusion that individuality merges into void at liberation",
        "The concept that material and spiritual energy are fundamentally same",
        "The belief that karma-yoga is superior to bhakti-yoga in all cases"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada refutes the Mayavadi conclusion that individual souls lose their identity at liberation. The Gita's teachings presume individual existence continuing after liberation. Impersonalism is a misunderstanding, not ultimate truth. This challenges the widespread false belief that merging is the spiritual goal.",

        "They exist forever; there was never a time when they did not exist",

        "They are all the same being without individual identity or uniqueness"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krsna teaches that individual souls exist eternally; there is no time when they did not exist and no time when they will cease to exist. This refutes the impersonalist idea that individuality is temporary.",

        "Individual souls temporarily exist but merge at liberation into the Supreme as explained here",
        "Krsna, Arjuna, and all beings maintain eternal individual existence even after liberation",
        "Only Krsna maintains individuality while souls become impersonal energy at all",
        "Individuality is maya's illusion that disappears with spiritual advancement at all"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The Gita explicitly states that Krsna, Arjuna, and all beings existed as individuals in the past, exist now, and will continue as individuals in the future. Eternal individuality of the soul is a fundamental Vedic truth. The impersonalist idea of merging is a philosophical mistake that ignores clear scriptural evidence.",

      "choices": [
        "Both are on the same level of realization and spiritual understanding",
        "Both are equally deluded by maya's influence and material energy",
        "Krsna is superior, Arjuna is forgetful soul deluded by maya",
        "Arjuna is the Supreme teaching the subordinate Krsna divine knowledge"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Krsna is the Supreme Lord superior to Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by maya. This hierarchy is essential for genuine instruction to occur. The Mayavadi theory that guru and disciple are equal is refuted by the Gita itself.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Krsna compares the soul's journey through childhood, youth, and old age to show that the soul remains the same while the body changes. Understanding this helps us not be bewildered by bodily changes.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krsna uses the simple analogy that just as we change old clothes for new ones, the soul takes on a new body when the old one dies. This makes reincarnation easy to understand.",
