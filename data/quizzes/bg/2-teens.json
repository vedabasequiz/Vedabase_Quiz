      "prompt": "In BG 2.2, what does Krsna point out to Arjuna?",
      "choices": [
        "His military strategy is weak and will lead directly to defeat",
        "He is showing weakness and sadness even though he is a warrior",
        "His weapons are not strong enough for this particular difficult battle",
        "He should have run away earlier from the battlefield and escaped"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krsna tells Arjuna that he is acting weakly and unmanly despite being a warrior, and should overcome this weakness. Sometimes compassion based on bodily identification must be overcome. This teaches us that sentiment masquerading as compassion is not spiritual advancement.",

      "prompt": "In the purport to BG 2.2, Srila Prabhupada explains three realizations of Absolute Truth using the sun analogy. Which realization represents the highest?",
      "choices": [
        "Understanding the sunshine represents Brahman realization which is lower stage",
        "Knowing the sun's surface represents Paramatma realization which is intermediate",
        "Entering the sun planet represents Bhagavan realization which is highest",
        "All three are equal according to impersonal philosophy taught by Mayavadis"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "The bhaktas who realize Bhagavan are topmost transcendentalists, like those who enter the sun planet. Personal realization of God is higher than impersonal realization. This challenges the false idea that all paths and realizations are equal.",

        "Arjuna's compassion represents genuine spiritual realization and advancement as explained here",
        "Weakness arising from material attachment is different from spiritual humility",
        "All forms of compassion are equally valuable spiritually speaking",
        "Arjuna demonstrates perfect understanding of transcendental duty at all"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada distinguishes material weakness from spiritual humility. Arjuna's depression stems from bodily attachment, not soul consciousness. True spiritual humility means surrendering to Krsna's will while performing duty, not emotional breakdown. This challenges the false idea that all compassion is spiritual.",

        "A wise person should mourn continuously to show proper compassion"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Krsna begins His philosophical instruction by stating that the wise do not lament for either living or dead. This verse establishes the foundation: the soul is eternal and separate from the body. Lamentation based on bodily identification is a sign of ignorance, not wisdom. True knowledge eliminates grief by revealing the soul's immortal nature.",

        "They are all the same being without individual identity or uniqueness"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krsna teaches that individual souls exist eternally; there was never a time when they did not exist and there will never be a time when they cease to exist. Each person maintains their individual identity forever.",

        "Individual souls temporarily exist but merge at liberation into the Supreme as explained here",
        "Krsna, Arjuna, and all beings maintain eternal individual existence even after liberation",
        "Only Krsna maintains individuality while souls become impersonal energy at all",
        "Individuality is maya's illusion that disappears with spiritual advancement at all"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The Gita clearly teaches that Krsna, Arjuna, and all beings existed as individuals in the past, exist now, and will continue as individuals in the future. Our individual identity as a soul is eternal and never disappears.",

        "Both are equally deluded by maya's influence and material energy",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Krsna is the Supreme Lord, while Arjuna is a forgetful soul who needs guidance. This hierarchy allows real teaching to happen. For instruction to be effective, the teacher must have superior knowledge and the student must be receptive.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "A person who remains calm and steady even when experiencing happiness or sadness is qualified to reach a higher spiritual state. Equanimity is a sign of spiritual advancement. This transcendental steadiness comes from understanding the soul's eternal nature beyond bodily pleasures and pains.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krsna uses the simple analogy that just as we change old clothes for new ones, the soul takes on a new body when the old one dies. This makes reincarnation easy to understand. This practical analogy helps us overcome fear of death.",
