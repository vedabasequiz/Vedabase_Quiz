      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Arjuna misunderstands sankhya (knowledge) vs karma-yoga (action) relationship-treating as mutually exclusive alternatives. The trap: dichotomous thinking about spiritual paths. Why this matters: The false path is intellectual-practical split-assuming knowledge opposes action when actually genuine knowledge includes proper devotional action. Real understanding: True jnana culminates in Krishna consciousness activity; theoretical understanding divorced from service reveals incomplete realization. Arjuna's confusion stems from monist contamination-thinking enlightenment means cessation. This foreshadows Ch3's teaching-karma-yoga as knowledge's practical expression not its opposite. Therefore knowledge-action synthesis defines authentic spirituality; separating them creates artificial dilemma resolved through integrated bhakti-yoga.",

      "feedback": "Conditioned soul forced to act by prakrti's gunas even when unwilling-illustrates helplessness under false ego. The trap: voluntarism-believing willpower controls action. Why this matters: The false path is assuming autonomy-thinking 'I can stop anytime' while mechanically driven by modes, producing illusion of independence. Real understanding: Material nature (prakrti) compels action through three gunas-tamas, rajas, sattva. Soul under false ego cannot resist these impulses-sattvic acts virtuously, rajasic frantically, tamasic destructively, all involuntarily. Only transcending modes through Krishna consciousness provides actual freedom. This exposes modern autonomous-self mythology-apparent choices are mode-expressions. Therefore liberation requires transcending material platform entirely, not just making better material choices.",

The trap: external discipline equals internal transformation. Why this matters: The false path is mechanistic spirituality-controlling actions without purifying desires, producing forced suppression not genuine transcendence. Real understanding: Mind's attachment persists despite bodily control-like prisoner in cell still craving freedom. True vairagya requires internal shift from desire to satisfaction in self, not external constraint masking unchanged consciousness. This exposes ascetic pretense-yoga-pants and meditation-poses without transformed consciousness. Therefore test spirituality by consciousness not external behavior-transformed mind naturally manifests in action, but controlled action doesn't guarantee transformed mind.",

Why this matters: The false path is confusing cessation with transcendence-thinking spiritual advancement requires physical withdrawal from duties, producing passivity disguised as detachment. Real understanding: Proper action in Krishna consciousness transcends both material activity (karma-bandha) and material inactivity (false renunciation). Not choosing between action-inaction but transforming action's motivation from selfish to selfless. Body can't remain inactive anyway (BG 3.5)-question is whether activity binds or liberates.

Real understanding: Identical activities generate opposite results-cooking for Krishna vs cooking for self, speaking for preaching vs speaking for profit. Yajna transforms work from binding to liberating not by changing activity but consciousness. This reveals purpose supremely important-not just what you do but why determines spiritual effect. Therefore sanctify all activities through yajna-orientation (offering to Krishna), converting mundane necessities into liberating service.",

Why this matters: The false path is book-wisdom without guru-guidance-assuming intellectual study suffices without living relationship to realized teacher, producing theoretical knowledge without practical realization. Real understanding: Krishna consciousness isn't information-transfer but consciousness-transmission-requires guru's personal guidance recognizing individual's conditioning and prescribing tailored sadhana. Books provide framework; guru provides application. Prabhurada emphasizes 'in the beginning'-acknowledges early vulnerability requiring protection from deviation.

Why this matters: The false path is demigod-shopping-approaching various devas for specific benefits, missing that all derive power from Vishnu's sanction. Real understanding: Devas aren't independent competitors but Supreme's functional representatives-like government departments under prime minister. Satisfying center satisfies periphery; worshiping Vishnu satisfies all devas through constitutional structure. This exposes materialistic deity-selection where devas treated as vending machines dispensing specific commodities. Therefore worship Vishnu/Krishna exclusively-simultaneously satisfies all devas while transcending material benefit platform for pure devotional relationship.",

Why this matters: The false path is either material (blessed food has superior nutrients) or magical (mantras transform molecules)-missing transcendental relationship transforming consciousness. Real understanding: Krishna accepts devotee's love expressed through offering; purified by His touch, remnants (prasadam) carry spiritual potency transforming eater's consciousness. Not chemical change but relational exchange-eating becomes communion with Supreme. Self-centered eating accumulates papa (sin) through sense gratification; Krishna-centered eating through prasadam liberates. Therefore spiritualize basic necessity (eating) through bhakti-offering, demonstrating how every activity can become Krishna conscious.",

Why this matters: The false path is mechanical compliance-offering from duty not love, producing perfunctory gesture without heart-connection. Real understanding: Advanced devotees' love prevents enjoying separately from Krishna-like lover wanting beloved to share everything first. Not external rule imposed but internal impulse emerging from relationship. Shows offering's motivation-trajectory from obligation (neophyte) through habit (intermediate) to spontaneous love (advanced). Therefore cultivate affection generating natural offering-spirit, not just follow procedure externally-relationship transforms regulation from burden to joy.",

Real understanding: Sankirtana (chanting Hare Krishna) available to everyone regardless of external conditions-no initiation, no expense, no special venue required. This democratic accessibility reflects Krishna's generosity-everyone can participate immediately.

Why this matters: The false path is existentialist self-determination-assuming individual creates life's meaning apart from cosmic structure, producing hedonistic solipsism disguised as authentic existence. Real understanding: Refusing yajna-cakra (sacrifice wheel) participation eliminates transcendent purpose-only bodily gratification remains. Body-centered life (aghayur indriyaramo) is objectively purposeless because ignores soul's constitutional function-serving Supreme. This isn't authoritarian constraint but ontological reality-like fish refusing water claiming autonomous existence.

Real understanding: Self-realized person's satisfaction comes from atma-realization (soul-knowledge) and Krishna-relationship, independent of external circumstances. Not deprivation-based detachment but satisfaction-based transcendence-higher pleasure eclipses lower naturally.

Why this matters: The false path is either mechanical performance hoping to accumulate piety, or forced emotional neutrality requiring constant vigilance-both missing purification's relational dimension. Real understanding: Desireless action performed as offering gradually cleanses heart of false proprietorship-'my work, my results, my enjoyment.' Purification isn't external ablution but consciousness transformation-seeing self as Krishna's servant not independent enjoyer. Cleaned consciousness naturally gravitates toward its source (Krishna)-like purified water naturally flows downhill.

Real understanding: Perfection available through any varnashrama position when performed in Krishna consciousness without selfish attachment. Janaka as raja (king) engaged fully in governance/warfare/administration while maintaining transcendental consciousness-demonstrates detachment-in-action not detachment-through-inaction.

Loka-sangraha means maintaining social order facilitating mass spiritual advancement-creating conditions enabling others' Krishna consciousness.

Real understanding: Leaders' actions set precedents-yad yad acarati sreshthas (whatever great ones do) becomes jana-samudro (public standard). If maha-atmas act materialistically, masses follow materialistically; if transcendentally, masses follow transcendentally.

Real understanding: Hrishikesha means Krishna owns and controls all senses-individual's sensory capacity is borrowed facility meant for His service. Sense gratification (using Krishna's property for self) constitutes theft and rebellion. Bewilderment (moha) from material engagement makes one forget actual ownership-structure.

Real understanding: Material nature executes Krishna's plan-three gunas compelling embodied soul's actions. False ego misattributes authorship to self or blind nature-missing conscious Controller behind mechanism. Yajna-orientation corrects ontology-recognizing Krishna as real agent, nature as instrument, self as servant.

      "feedback": "False renunciation restrains externally while internal attachment continues; regulated Krishna-service redirects desire, actually transforming consciousness. The trap: behavior-modification spirituality. Why this matters: The false path is external-focus-controlling actions without addressing desires, producing suppression-based practice requiring constant effort without transformation. Real understanding: Cessation doesn't purify mind because desire-structure remains intact though temporarily constrained-like dammed river still wanting to flow. Regulated engagement in Krishna's service provides superior satisfaction, naturally displacing material desire through higher taste. Not fighting desire directly but transcending it through spiritual engagement-occupation in Krishna consciousness automatically reduces material attachment. Therefore regulate senses in devotional service rather than merely restraining them-active redirection more effective than passive suppression.",

The trap: lust-fighting through suppression. Why this matters: The false path is direct combat with lust-trying to eliminate by willpower alone, producing exhausting struggle often ending in defeat. Real understanding: Lust (kama) isn't destroyed by opposition but displaced by higher engagement-Krishna-conscious activity provides satisfaction surpassing lust's promises. Fighting lust directly empowers it through attention; serving Krishna starves it through neglect. Like child abandoning toy when receiving better toy-not forced abandonment but natural displacement. Therefore engage senses in Krishna's service-hearing about Him, chanting His names, serving His devotees-gradually weakening lust through disinterest rather than frontal assault.",

Why this matters: The false path is kamya-karma mentality-performing yajna to obtain material results, treating cosmic order as vending machine dispensing rewards for inputs. Real understanding: Real yajna is consciousness-purification process-performing prescribed role without selfish motive cleanses ahankara (false ego) claiming 'I own, I control, I enjoy.' Purified consciousness recognizes Krishna's ownership and one's service position-constitutional reality obscured by material conditioning. Self-realized (3.17) already sees this clearly; conditioned souls purify through detached yajna gradually. Therefore perform duties as offerings without result-seeking-mechanism transforming material consciousness into spiritual consciousness through practice.",

Real understanding: Modern self-made narratives exemplify false-ego delusion-genetic endowment, social circumstances, historical moment, random opportunities all beyond individual origination, yet claimed as personal credit. Actually nature (Krishna's energy) provides all facilities-individual merely uses them well or poorly. This exposes metaphysical error-confusing ability-to-choose with ability-to-originate, treating conditioned agency as absolute agency.

Why this matters: The false path is assuming one standard fits all-advanced practices prescribed to neophytes, or neophyte practices mandated for advanced, producing either artificial imitation or spiritual stagnation. Real understanding: Gradual elevation principle-work with current conditioning, elevating through prescribed duties performed for Vishnu rather than demanding quantum leaps. Maha-atmas can work non-attached while maintaining example; forcing ordinary persons to renounce prematurely creates social/spiritual chaos. This validates varnashrama-dharma's graduated approach-meeting people where they are, guiding through current duties toward transcendence. Therefore don't impose advanced renunciation on unprepared persons-elevate gradually through Krishna-conscious duty-performance appropriate to current position.",

Real understanding: Stress derives ultimately from constitutional dysfunction-soul employed in self-centered projects disconnected from Supreme source. Sankirtana-yajna (nama-offering transforming all activities) restores constitutional relationship-work becomes service, reconnecting individual to transcendent meaning.
