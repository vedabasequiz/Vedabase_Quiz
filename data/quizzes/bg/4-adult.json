      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krsna declares imam vivasvate yogam proktavan (I spoke this yoga to Vivasvan)-establishes ancient parampara from Krsna -> Vivasvan -> Manu -> Ikshvaku demonstrating knowledge's eternal nature. Why this matters: Timeless truth transmitted through disciplic succession validates Vedic epistemology-knowledge descends from perfect source (Krsna) through realized gurus, not ascending from human speculation. Approach transcendental knowledge through parampara not independent research-truth isn't discovered but received from knowers.",

        "Material degradation automatically destroys all spiritual wisdom"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Parampara (disciplic succession) maintains knowledge evam paramparaya (thus in succession), preventing deviation through authorized transmission. Realization requires receiving understanding from those who received from their gurus back to original speaker-not just reading words independently. Sa kaleneha yogo nashtah (with time this yoga was lost) shows deviation's inevitability without living tradition. Lineage ensures fidelity to original meaning against time's corrupting influence.",

      "feedback": "Correct: Verse distinguishes Krsna (veda-aham-I know) from Arjuna (na vettha-you don't know) regarding past births-qualitative difference not quantitative. Krsna possesses complete memory of infinite births because never covered by maya; Arjuna forgets due to material conditioning. This constitutional difference (ever-free vs conditionally-bound) establishes Krsna's supreme position-not another seeker but eternal Teacher possessing perfect omniscience.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Krsna appears yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati (whenever decline of dharma)-principle of periodic descent. Why this matters: Regular incarnation (avatara) constitutes cosmic maintenance-system-Krsna descends precisely when dharma declines, establishing rhythm of revelation-decline-restoration. This demonstrates Krsna's ongoing involvement-not deist God creating then abandoning but active maintainer periodically intervening through incarnations maintaining dharmic order.",

      "feedback": "Correct: Krsna's dual purpose-paritranaya sadhunam (protect devotees) and vinashaya dushkritam (destroy miscreants)-demonstrates completeness not contradiction. Krsna simultaneously merciful (protecting sadhus) and just (destroying evil)-authentic compassion requires removing adharma to protect innocent. Evil requires active opposition not passive acceptance-protecting good necessitates destroying evil for collective welfare.",

      "feedback": "Correct: Knowing Krsna's transcendental birth (divyam) and activities (karma) liberates-tyaktva deham punar janma naiti (leaving body, doesn't take birth again). Divyam means transcendental-knowing them tattvatah (in truth) requires devotional consciousness not just intellectual comprehension. Mam eti (comes to Me)-liberation means personal relationship not impersonal absorption. Approach Krsna's pastimes devotionally-hearing/chanting with bhakti transforms knowledge into liberation.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Vita-raga-bhaya-krodha (free from attachment-fear-anger), mam-mayah (absorbed in Me)-purification through bhakti substitutes material absorption with Krsna-absorption. Purification isn't mere subtraction (removing bad qualities) but substitution-consciousness filled with Krsna leaves no space for material contaminations. Tapasa (austerity) works when directed toward Krsna not merely away from material. Positive bhakti naturally eliminates negatives through engagement not renunciation.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Catur-varnyam (four orders) created maya (by Me) according to guna-karma (quality-work)-divine social organization. Why this matters: Varnashrama created by Krsna according to guna (quality) and karma (activity)-not birth nor arbitrary social agreement but divinely designed order reflecting psychophysical nature. Varna determined by qualities demonstrated and work performed-validates natural diversity while preventing exploitation. Follow varnashrama-dharma according to actual qualities-facilitating both material stability and spiritual advancement.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: In the BG 4.13 purport, Srila Prabhupada explains that although Krsna creates the varnashrama arrangement (catur-varnyam), He remains the supreme controller and is not implicated like a conditioned soul. He sets the system by His will, while the modes of nature carry out activities and bind those who falsely claim doership. Knowing Krsna as the ultimate director prevents the jiva from imitating Him as 'independent doer.' Why this matters: When we forget Krsna's position, we turn social duty into ego and exploitation; when we remember Him, duty becomes service and purification.",

Kuru karma (perform action) tasmad tvam (therefore you) purvaih purvataram (as ancients did earlier)-follow established effective procedure.

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Kim karma kim akarmeti (what is action, what is inaction)-wise are bewildered because consciousness determines action's nature, not external behavior. Apparently doing nothing while consciousness absorbed in material is action (binding); apparently doing everything while consciousness absorbed in Krsna is inaction (non-binding). Karmano gahana (action's nature is profound)-seek expert guidance discerning karma from akarma. External appearance doesn't reveal consciousness-quality determining spiritual effect.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Must understand karma (action), vikarma (forbidden action), and akarma (inaction)-threefold discrimination beyond binary thinking. Three categories-karma (prescribed duties binding if performed selfishly), vikarma (prohibited acts always binding), akarma (devotional service appearing as action but non-binding). Gahana karmano gatih (profound is the way of action)-requires subtle discrimination.

        "Detachment allows full action without generating karmic bondage",

Abandons phalasanga (result-attachment) not karma (action itself)-inner freedom maintaining outer engagement. Karmani abhipravrittah api (engaged in activities nevertheless) naiva kinchit karoti (does nothing at all)-paradox resolved through consciousness-quality.

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: BG 4.2 shows that knowledge is preserved only when parampara remains intact; when the living chain breaks, the meaning is lost. BG 4.34 gives the method to enter that living succession: approach a tattva-darshi guru with pranipata (surrender), pariprasna (sincere inquiry), and seva (service). This is how 'received' knowledge becomes realized knowledge, not merely information from texts. Why this matters: Independent interpretation is an easy false path; submission to parampara protects the original intent and transforms the heart, not just the mind.",

        "The Docetic error that divine incarnation is illusory appearance",

      "feedback": "Correct: Detachment from results (BG 4.19-23) purifies the worker by removing the root disease: 'I am the enjoyer and owner.' As desire and proprietorship fade, real knowledge awakens-and that awakened knowledge makes sacrifice complete. Therefore BG 4.33 says knowledge-sacrifice is superior to material sacrifice: it targets ignorance and motive, not only external ritual. Why this matters: Without knowledge, sacrifice easily becomes a transaction for prestige or reward; with knowledge, the same acts become akarma-service that does not bind.",

Because they are attached to material personality, they assume 'person' must be material and therefore reject the Lord's eternal form and the soul's eternal individuality. Why this matters: Fear of personality pushes people toward impersonal 'merging,' but bhakti teaches purified personality-eternal relationship with Krsna-which is higher than annihilating the self.",

Impersonalist commentaries similarly use Gita's authority while rejecting Krsna's personal supremacy-academic pretense studying text while denying the speaker's nature.

Why this matters: The bubble analogy impersonalists use proves the opposite-individual souls fear dissolution not liberation, desiring personal existence eternally.

      "choices": [
        "The caste confusion that birth determines spiritual qualification permanently",
        "Natural duties purify modes; transcendence via devotion regardless of position",
        "The egalitarian error that social distinctions obstruct spiritual equality",
        "The gradualist misconception that caste determines spiritual hierarchy"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Varnashrama based on guna and karma (BG 4.13) provides purification path through natural duties performed in Krsna consciousness. Transcendence (BG 4.9-10, 4.15) via devotional service is available regardless of social position-any varna can attain perfection through bhakti. Natural duties purify modes gradually; devotion to Krsna transcends mode-bound existence. Follow prescribed duties as offerings to Krsna-social position becomes vehicle for spiritual advancement.",

      "choices": [
        "The fundamentalist error of blind acceptance without understanding",
        "Humble surrender with sincere inquiry and practical service-not blind following or proud debate",
        "The skeptic's pride demanding proof before commitment or surrender",
        "They are contradictory suggesting both surrender and independence"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct: Pranapata (obeisances), pariprasna (inquiry), and seva (service) balance submission with intelligence-both require humble submission rejecting pride in intellect. Neither blind acceptance without understanding nor skeptical pride demanding proof before commitment-proper attitude combines surrender with sincere desire to understand. The guru reveals knowledge to those who approach with this balanced attitude. Satisfaction of self-realized spiritual master through service is the secret of advancement.",
