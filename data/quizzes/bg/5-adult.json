Bodies differ vastly-learned brahmana versus outcaste, noble animal versus dog-but atma equal in all. Equal vision doesn't erase functional distinctions-brahmana receives honor for knowledge, chandala performs appropriate service, but spiritual value equal. Learned transcend bodily designations seeing soul-maintain social/functional distinctions without spiritual contempt. Sama-drishti recognizes qualitative spiritual equality while acknowledging bodily variety-souls have equal spiritual value despite unequal material circumstances.",

Purport clarifies Mayavada error-impersonalists wrongly claim souls merge completely with Supreme, erasing quantitative distinction. Similarity in quality doesn't equal quantitative identity-drop of ocean-water shares water-quality but not ocean's quantity. Souls eternally individual though qualitatively similar to Paramatma. Understanding qualitative similarity without quantitative equality prevents Mayavada mistake-honors soul's divine nature while maintaining eternal individual distinction from infinite Supreme.",

Peace attempts maintaining false proprietorship remain superficial-'my nation, my resources, my rights' creates conflict. Without recognizing actual owner/enjoyer/well-wisher, peace efforts treat symptoms not disease. Genuine peace requires ontological correction-acknowledging cosmic reality that Krsna owns/enjoys/befriends all. Peace formula works through accurate understanding-recognizing Krsna as actual proprietor dissolves possessive conflicts enabling authentic harmony.",
