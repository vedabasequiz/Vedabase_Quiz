      "feedback": "Krishna says that by hearing about Him while practicing yoga with mind devoted to Him, one can know Him fully. Why this matters: A common false path is treating Krishna as a mere subject of study; devotion (mat-parah) makes knowledge transformative, not just informational.

The material reductionist trap treats consciousness as a byproduct of chemical combinations, missing that living entities are Krishna's superior energy. Souls are neither material products nor identical with the Supreme, but intermediate - simultaneously one with and different from Krishna (acintya-bhedabheda).
