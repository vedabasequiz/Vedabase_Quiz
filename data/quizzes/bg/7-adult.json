Why this matters: The false path is academic Krishna-study-learning philosophy/theology without mat-parah (devotional orientation), producing theoretical knowledge not transformative realization. Real understanding: Complete knowledge (asamshayam samagram) requires asaktena (detached from material) plus mat-parah (devoted to Krishna)-devotional relationship providing framework for genuine understanding. Hearing about Krishna (mayi shrinvat) in devotional consciousness enables complete realization. Therefore approach Krishna-knowledge devotionally-not as subject for study but as Person for relationship, transforming information-gathering into devotional realization.",

Why this matters: The false path is limiting Krishna to sublime experiences-only special fragrances/brilliant fires/extraordinary lives, missing He's present in all instances of category as essence. Real understanding: Universal presence through essential qualities-punyo gandhah (pure fragrance) indicates fragrances' common essence not particular smell.

Real understanding: Krishna is buddhi buddhimatam (intelligence of intelligent), tejas tejasvinam (prowess of powerful)-not praising individual but recognizing source. Every intelligence/power manifests Krishna's presence-great and small. Individual excellence should direct attention upward to source not terminating in person.

Real understanding: Strength without kama-raga (lust-attachment) is Krishna; and kama aviruddha dharma (desire not contrary to dharma)-regulated desire compatible with Krishna. Not all desire is lust-dharmic desire for progeny/service/protection represents Krishna.

Real understanding: Modes originate mattah (from Me) but na aham teshu (not I in them)-Krishna source of gunas but transcends them. Asymmetrical relationship-modes depend on Krishna, Krishna independent of modes. This preserves both immanence (modes from Krishna) and transcendence (Krishna beyond modes).

      "choices": [
        "That demigods are completely imaginary and worshiping them produces no results",

The trap is being satisfied with lesser attainments. Why this matters: The false path is seeking material solutions from demigods while neglecting Krishna. Real intelligence directs worship to the Supreme Source who can grant both material and spiritual perfection.",

        "Maya (material energy) is Krishna's divine potency and insurmountable except by surrendering to Him",

      "feedback": "This synthesis reveals the paradox of spiritual life: maya (Krishna's inferior energy) is divine and insurmountable by material effort, yet Krishna's superior energy (the living entities) can transcend it through surrender. The living entity is superior to matter but inferior to Krishna. Why this matters: The false path is attempting self-improvement without grace. The psychological trap is pride in personal effort. Real transcendence recognizes that only by connecting to the Supreme through surrender can the soul overcome the divine illusion. This explains why Chapter 6's yoga requires devotion, not just technique.",

Real understanding: Demigod-worshipers reach deva-lokas (temporary heavenly planets) with antavat phalam (limited results)-returns to material cycle. Krishna's devotees reach Him-permanent liberation. Therefore recognize destination-difference-not all worship equally efficacious, deity-choice determines outcome-quality, Krishna-worship alone transcending material rebirth-cycle while demigod-worship yielding temporary elevation within material existence.",

Real understanding: Mudhah (foolish) think avyaktam (unmanifest/impersonal) vyaktim apannam (has become manifest/personal)-that formless becomes formed through material manifestation. Don't understand param avyayam bhavam (supreme imperishable nature)-Krishna eternally possesses transcendental form not acquired through material birth. Therefore recognize Krishna's eternal form-not that formless becomes formed but that transcendental form appears/disappears in material vision, preserving divinity against Mayavada reduction.",

The trap: universal divine accessibility. Why this matters: The false path is automatic Krishna-realization-assuming sincere interest suffices for darshana, missing yoga-maya covering preventing casual vision. Real understanding: Krishna not prakashash (revealed) to everyone-covered by yoga-maya (internal potency). Mudha (foolish) material-oriented persons don't recognize ajam avyayam (unborn imperishable)-requires spiritual qualification. This explains why most don't perceive Krishna despite presence. Therefore cultivate qualification-Krishna reveals proportional to purification, not automatically visible but disclosed to prepared consciousness, requiring devotional practice removing yoga-maya covering.",
