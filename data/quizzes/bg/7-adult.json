      "feedback": "This synthesis reveals the dynamic nature of bhakti: the distressed and desiring are pious for approaching Krishna, but the goal is the jnani who serves with pure devotion. After many births, such a wise soul recognizes Vasudeva as all. The progression shows: (1) Material motivation is acceptable starting point, (2) Continued association purifies desires, (3) Wisdom culminates in seeing Krishna as everything. Why this matters: The false path is either rejecting beginners or remaining satisfied with conditional devotion. Real spiritual life is transformative - we can begin with mixed motives but must allow Krishna to purify us into pure lovers. This connects to Chapter 6's teaching that yoga perfection requires abandoning material desires (6.24).",

        "Because Krishna is covered by yoga-maya and foolish people cannot understand Him properly",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Srila Prabhupada explains that Krishna is covered by His internal yoga-maya potency. Foolish people who do not surrender cannot understand Him. The psychological insight: Krishna reveals Himself to devotees but remains hidden from those who reject Him. Why this matters: The false path is thinking Krishna is bound to reveal Himself to our speculation. Real understanding comes through devotional surrender, not intellectual prowess.",
