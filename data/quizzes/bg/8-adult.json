      "prompt": "How does Chapter 8's teaching about transcending all material worlds (8.15-16) and cosmic time cycles (8.17-19) support the conclusion that devotional service surpasses all other spiritual practices (8.28)?",
      "choices": [
        "Material elevation to higher planets is sufficient for happiness, so devotional service is optional",
        "Since all material realms are temporary and bound by time, only reaching Krishna's eternal abode provides permanent liberation from suffering",
        "Cosmic time cycles eventually purify all souls automatically without any need for devotional effort",
        "The spiritual world is merely a more refined material planet within Brahma's vast universe"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "This synthesis reveals the ontological hierarchy that necessitates bhakti: Even Brahmaloka (highest material planet with 311 trillion year lifespan) undergoes annihilation. The repeated creation-destruction cycles (8.19) trap souls with material desires. All material destinations - whether hellish, earthly, or heavenly - are temporary (duhkhalayam asasvatam, 8.15). Therefore, no amount of Vedic rituals, austerities, or charities can provide permanent relief. Only devotional service (8.28) enables the soul to transcend maya entirely and reach Krishna's supreme eternal abode (param dhama, 8.20-21) from which there is no return to suffering. This explains why Chapter 6's yoga must culminate in devotion, not mere technique.",
