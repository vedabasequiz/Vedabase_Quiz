      "choices": [
        "Daily practice shapes the mind, so steady Krishna consciousness makes remembrance at death natural; for example, a devotee who chants and serves daily will think of Krishna at the end.",
        "Rituals alone guarantee spiritual success, so daily consciousness is not required for attainment.",
        "The final moment is unpredictable, so daily practice is less important; only last-minute effort matters for the soul's journey.",

      "feedback": "Daily Krishna consciousness trains the mind for the final test at death. The false path is thinking that last-minute effort, ritual, or fate alone determines the outcome. Real understanding: Steady, daily practice makes remembrance of Krishna natural at the end. Example: A devotee who chants and serves daily will naturally think of Krishna at the final moment. Practice: Make Krishna consciousness a daily habit, not a last-minute hope.",
