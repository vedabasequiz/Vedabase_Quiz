Why this matters: The false path is treating spiritual categories as abstract philosophy-discussing Brahman/adhyatma academically without death-time preparation, missing practical urgency. Real understanding: Arjuna's questions link metaphysical categories (Brahman/adhyatma/karma) with practical concern-how known anta-kale (at death time). Theory must enable practice-understanding these tattvas (truths) for death-time consciousness. Therefore study with practical intent-not accumulating information but preparing consciousness for death-transition, transforming abstract theology into applicable death-preparation discipline.",

The trap: impersonal liberation finality. Why this matters: The false path is treating moksha as identity-loss in Brahman-effulgence-seeking impersonal merger as ultimate goal, missing personal Krishna-abode as supreme destination. Real understanding: Avyakta akshara (unmanifest imperishable) is mama dhama (My abode)-personal supreme destination not impersonal void. Parama gati (highest goal) is reaching Krishna's personal abode from which na nivartante (no return). Therefore seek personal destination-not impersonal dissolution but personal relationship in Krishna's transcendental abode, correcting impersonalist misconception that highest realization means identity-loss.",

Why this matters: The false path is mechanical time-determinism-thinking departure-timing alone determines destination, missing consciousness-quality primacy. Real understanding: Two paths-shukla (bright) and krishna (dark)-where departing yogins reach no-return or return. But timing facilitates-consciousness prepared through lifetime practice determines actual destination regardless of physical death-time. Therefore prioritize consciousness-preparation-auspicious death-timing helps but doesn't substitute for lifetime cultivation, developing death-time Krishna-remembrance through present practice not relying on lucky timing.",

The trap: death-bed conversion mentality - thinking one can live materially but remember Krishna at the end. Why this matters: The false path is postponing practice. Real preparation requires integrating Krishna consciousness throughout life, transforming all activities into devotional service. This connects to Chapter 6's teaching that yoga requires constant practice (6.26), not sporadic effort.",

Real understanding: Knowing paths (jnanann) prevents moha (bewilderment)-but requires practical application: sarvehu kaleshu (at all times) yoga-yukta bhava (be engaged in yoga). Knowledge serves practice-understanding paths inspires continuous Krishna-yoga.
