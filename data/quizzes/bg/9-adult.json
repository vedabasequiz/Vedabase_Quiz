      "feedback": "The synthesis: Krishna accepts offerings based solely on devotion, not material value or qualification. A leaf offered with bhakti surpasses elaborate sacrifices without devotion. This connects to the chapter's central theme - confidential knowledge is universal accessibility through love. The philosophical resolution: devotion democratizes spirituality. Why this matters: the false path is thinking spiritual advancement requires material resources or social status. Real understanding: pure devotion alone qualifies one for the highest perfection, making Krishna consciousness available to all sincere souls regardless of external circumstances.",
