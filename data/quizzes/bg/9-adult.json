It is directly realizable through experience, brings supreme joy, and is eternal. This knowledge purifies one from all sinful reactions and is performed joyfully. The false path is treating this as mere theory or ritual. Real understanding: This knowledge transforms consciousness and brings direct realization.

        "That Krishna has no personal form and is only an impersonal energy without qualities, which is a misunderstanding addressed in the purport.",

The impersonalist trap: thinking 'unmanifested' means formless or impersonal. Why this matters: The false path is concluding that Krishna's all-pervasiveness negates His personal form. Real understanding: Krishna simultaneously maintains His personal form while pervading creation through His energies, like a king's power pervades his kingdom while he remains a person.

Krishna superintends by His glance, activating material nature, but has nothing to do with manifestation directly. The philosophical insight: supreme control without direct involvement. Why this matters: The false path is thinking Krishna must be contaminated by material contact if He manages creation. Real understanding: Krishna's transcendental position allows Him to control everything while remaining completely pure and aloof. Practice: Trust Krishna's transcendence even as He manages the world.",

The trap: judging spiritual by material standards. Why this matters: The false path is anthropomorphism - thinking God's human-like form is material limitation. Real understanding accepts that Krishna's form is purely spiritual and supreme. Practice: Meditate on Krishna's divine form with reverence.",

      "feedback": "Correct. Krishna explains that the destination of worshipers is determined by whom they worship. Demigod worshipers go to demigods, ancestor worshipers to ancestors, ghost worshipers to ghosts, and Krishna's devotees come to Him. The false path is thinking all worship leads to the same result. Real understanding: Consciousness and object of worship determine one's destination. Practice: Direct your worship to Krishna for the highest result.",

The trap: being satisfied with material rewards even from spiritual practices. Why this matters: The false path is using spiritual means for material ends. Real devotees seek Krishna, not improved material conditions, even in heaven. Practice: Seek Krishna's association, not just material rewards, in your spiritual practice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yoga means achieving material prosperity and kshema means protecting accumulated wealth from loss, as some may believe.",
        "Yoga means Krishna supplies what they lack and kshema means He preserves what they have, as explained by Srila Prabhupada for pure devotees.",

      "feedback": "Correct. Srila Prabhupada explains that for those who think of Krishna constantly with exclusive devotion, Krishna personally carries what they lack (yoga) and preserves what they have (kshema). The devotee approaches the Lord without difficulty through this yoga, and once fully Krishna conscious, the Lord protects them from falling. Why this matters: the false path is thinking devotees must struggle materially while pursuing spirituality. Real understanding: exclusive devotion brings Krishna's personal intervention, relieving the devotee of material anxieties so consciousness can focus completely on Him. Practice: Depend on Krishna for all your needs, material and spiritual.",

      "choices": [
        "It shows that poverty and lack of education prevent most people from spiritual progress entirely, but Krishna teaches that devotion is accessible to all.",
        "It demonstrates that devotion requires only love, not wealth, status, or scholarly learning, making it accessible to all, as Krishna teaches in this verse.",
        "It proves that material offerings are unnecessary and devotion requires only meditation without action, but Krishna emphasizes action with devotion.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Krishna accepts offerings based solely on devotion, not material value or qualification. A leaf offered with bhakti surpasses elaborate sacrifices without devotion. This connects to the chapter's central theme - confidential knowledge is universal accessibility through love. The philosophical resolution: devotion democratizes spirituality. Why this matters: the false path is thinking spiritual advancement requires material resources or social status. Real understanding: pure devotion alone qualifies one for the highest perfection, making Krishna consciousness available to all sincere souls regardless of external circumstances. Practice: Offer even the simplest things to Krishna with love and devotion.",
