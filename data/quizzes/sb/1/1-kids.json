PRE-PUBLISH SELF-CHECK:
✓ Tier 1: 15 questions, all verses linked, kid-appropriate language (simple, enthusiastic)
✓ Tier 2: 20% epistemology (Q2, Q7, Q15 = 3/15 = 20%), 5 purport-reasoning questions (Q2, Q3, Q7, Q10, Q15), narrative anchoring present (assembly at Naimisaranya, Suta's qualifications, Kali-yuga context), false-path distractors included (speculation vs hearing from authority), bhakti supremacy framing (pure devotion vs material motivation), feedback 1-2 sentences simple and enthusiastic
✓ Tier 3: End synthesis question Q15 tests understanding of where knowledge resides after Krishna's departure, progressive difficulty (simpler narrative questions first, deeper philosophical questions toward end), plausible distractors (not obviously silly)
