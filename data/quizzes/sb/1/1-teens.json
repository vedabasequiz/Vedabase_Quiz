    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-01",
      "prompt": "1. In SB 1.1.1, who is identified as the primeval Lord and Absolute Truth?",
      "choices": [
        "The collective force of nature",
        "Brahma, the first created being",
        "The impersonal Brahman only",
        "Lord Sri Krishna, son of Vasudeva"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "feedback": "Correct. The opening verse establishes Krishna as the Absolute Truth and original cause. While Brahma creates within the universe, Krishna is the source from whom even Brahma receives knowledge. This sets the framework for understanding Krishna's supremacy throughout the Bhagavatam.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.1.1",

    },
    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-02",
      "prompt": "2. According to SB 1.1.1, how was Vedic knowledge originally transmitted?",
      "choices": [
        "The Lord imparted it directly into Brahma's heart",
        "Through Brahma's independent meditation and study",
        "By trial and error over many lifetimes",
        "Through empirical observation of nature"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct. This establishes a crucial epistemological principle: authoritative knowledge descends from the Supreme, not from below through speculation. Brahma couldn't independently discover Vedic knowledge\u2014it was revealed to him by Krishna. This refutes the idea that spiritual truth can be accessed through mental speculation or empirical methods alone.",

    },
    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-03",
      "prompt": "3. What critical error do Mayavadi impersonalists make according to the purport of SB 1.1.1?",
      "choices": [
        "They think they can become one with or equal to the Lord through their own effort",
        "They worship multiple gods equally",
        "They deny that God exists",
        "They reject the Vedas entirely"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct. Srila Prabhupada explains that impersonalists who think they can merge with or become equal to God are neither fully cognizant nor truly independent. This false confidence contradicts the verse's teaching that only Krishna is fully independent. The spiritual path requires surrender to superior authority, not attempts to usurp it.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-04",
      "prompt": "4. SB 1.1.2 uses the term 'projjhita-kaitava' meaning what?",
      "choices": [
        "Practicing religion casually without commitment",
        "Accepting all religious paths equally",
        "Completely rejecting materially motivated religiosity",
        "Combining different religious traditions"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Correct. The Bhagavatam categorically rejects 'covered' or motivated religion\u2014where people practice dharma for economic gain, sense pleasure, or even liberation conceived as escape. Only unmotivated devotion satisfies the self. This ruthless standard challenges comfortable religiosity practiced for personal benefit.",

      "choices": [
        "Those with superior intelligence and academic training",
        "Those who are pure in heart and free from envy (nirmatsara)",
        "Those born in brahmana families",
        "Those who perform severe austerities"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. The qualification is purity of heart and freedom from envy, not intellectual capacity or birth status. Envy creates a distorting lens that prevents accepting God's supremacy. This is a profound epistemological point: moral purity, not intellectual prowess, qualifies one to understand transcendental truth.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.1.2",

      "choices": [
        "Critical and analytical hearing",
        "Hearing while multitasking",
        "Casual, occasional hearing",
        "Attentive and submissive hearing (susrusu)"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "feedback": "Correct. The verse specifies \u015bu\u015br\u016b\u1e63u\u2014submissive and attentive hearing. The manner of reception is crucial; one must be anxious to hear with a receptive attitude, not a challenging one. This opposes the modern preference for critical interrogation over submissive reception as the proper epistemological stance for transcendental knowledge.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-07",
      "prompt": "7. Why does SB 1.1.3 warn against jumping to the Tenth Canto's confidential pastimes?",
      "choices": [
        "The Tenth Canto contains errors and should be avoided",
        "Professional reciters and impatient materialists will misunderstand without gradual preparation",
        "There is no warning; anyone can start anywhere",
        "The Tenth Canto is only for sannyasis"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. The purport warns that the mature fruit must be received properly through disciplic succession, not from professional reciters or those lacking preparation. Jumping to intimate pastimes without philosophical grounding leads to misunderstanding and treating sacred topics as entertainment. Gradual preparation builds the proper frame of reference.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.1.3",

    },
    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-08",
      "prompt": "8. According to SB 1.1.6, Suta Gosvami studied under what condition?",
      "choices": [
        "Through mystical revelation only",
        "Through public lectures and seminars",
        "Under proper guidance (anugrhitam) from qualified authorities",
        "Through independent critical study"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Correct. The verse emphasizes 'proper guidance'\u2014knowledge received through authorized disciplic succession. This opposes modern academic approaches valuing independent critical analysis. Transcendental knowledge requires submissive reception from one who has properly received it, not independent speculation regardless of brilliance.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.1.6",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/1/6/"
    },
    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-09",
      "prompt": "9. What quality of Suta Gosvami enabled him to receive complete knowledge from his masters (SB 1.1.8)?",
      "choices": [
        "His influential family connections",
        "His submissiveness to his spiritual masters",
        "His intellectual brilliance and quick understanding",
        "His performance of difficult austerities"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. His submissiveness was the key that unlocked his masters' mercy. Intelligence and austerity are insufficient without foundational humility before guru. This challenges modern pride in intellectual independence, teaching that transcendental knowledge is received as mercy through the proper posture of submissiveness, not achieved through personal prowess.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.1.8",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/1/8/"
    },
    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-10",
      "prompt": "10. How does SB 1.1.10 characterize people in Kali-yuga?",
      "choices": [
        "Devoted but lacking proper guidance",
        "Long-lived and peaceful but materialistic",
        "Short-lived, quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky, and always disturbed",
        "Physically weak but spiritually advanced"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Correct. This realistic assessment establishes the urgency of the Bhagavatam's message. People lack time for complex rituals and are bewildered by conflicting philosophies. The answer isn't to pretend conditions are better than they are, but to offer a process suited to the age\u2014simple hearing and chanting that can deliver even the most fallen.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.1.10",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/1/10/"
    },
    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-11",
      "prompt": "11. Why do the sages in SB 1.1.11 ask for the essence of all scriptures?",
      "choices": [
        "Because they want something new and different",
        "Because the scriptures contain contradictions",
        "Because the full scriptures are no longer available",
        "Because prescribed duties are numerous and human life is short"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "feedback": "Correct. Given Kali-yuga's short lifespans and limited intelligence, comprehensive study is impractical. They ask not for diluted teaching but concentrated essence. The Bhagavatam presents pure devotional service as that essence\u2014the culmination of all Vedic directives\u2014opposing both rigid fundamentalism and vague relativism.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.1.11",
      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/1/11/"
    },
    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-12",
      "prompt": "12. Why do the sages specifically request teachings from previous acaryas in SB 1.1.13?",
      "choices": [
        "Because new ideas are completely forbidden",
        "To avoid thinking for themselves",
        "To show cultural respect for tradition only",
        "To establish that truth comes through authorized succession, not novelty"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "feedback": "Correct. This establishes parampara (disciplic succession) as epistemological necessity. Authentic knowledge descends through guru-parampara, not from independent speculation. This guards against deviation disguised as 'updating' teachings for modern sensibilities\u2014often masking the desire to become an authority rather than submit to one.",

      "choices": [
        "Elaborate fire sacrifices performed perfectly",
        "Even unconscious chanting of Krishna's holy name",
        "Total material renunciation",
        "Complete mastery of all Vedic literature"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Even accidental contact with the name is powerful, revealing the Lord's causeless mercy. This provides hope for the fallen while challenging those relying solely on personal prowess. Transcendental sound is non-different from Krishna Himself. If unconscious chanting is powerful, conscious devoted chanting is incomparably more so.",

      "prompt": "14. Why can pure devotees sanctify more quickly than the Ganges river (SB 1.1.15)?",
      "choices": [
        "Devotees have the Lord in their hearts; the Ganges only touched His feet",
        "Devotees perform more rituals",
        "Devotees are older and more experienced",
        "The Ganges is just ordinary water"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct. The Ganges is sacred through indirect contact (touching Krishna's feet), but devotees have direct contact (Krishna in their hearts). This teaches us to value sadhu-sanga (association of saints) as the most valuable spiritual resource, above pilgrimage or ritual. Direct contact with the Lord's representative surpasses indirect contact through sacred geography.",

      "choices": [
        "Those seeking relief from suffering",
        "Those who have developed a taste for transcendental relationships with Him",
        "Those beginning spiritual life",
        "Only incarnations of God"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. This indicates an advanced stage\u2014not dutiful hearing but actual spiritual relish (rasa). The process begins with regulation but culminates in taste. This prevents both dry mechanical practice without aiming for rasa, and immature jumping to confidential subjects claiming rasa without qualification. The progression is natural: discipline leads to taste.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-16",
      "prompt": "16. What did Krishna's 'masked' human form accomplish according to SB 1.1.20?",
      "choices": [
        "It enabled Him to perform superhuman acts while appearing accessible as human",
        "It proved He was only human",
        "It made His teachings irrelevant",
        "It allowed Him to avoid responsibility"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct. Krishna appears human to attract our affection and enable genuine loving exchange, but His superhuman activities reveal His divinity. This paradox protects against both materialistic distortion (seeing Him as merely human) and impersonal dismissal (seeing the human form as illusion). Both accessibility and transcendence are maintained.",

        "Academic study",
        "Meditation in isolation",
        "Sacrifice (yajna)",
        "Physical austerity"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Correct. Attentive hearing is redefined as sacrificial activity for Kali-yuga. This isn't a lesser alternative; it's the appropriate sacrifice for this age. The false dichotomy between ritualists and devotees dissolves\u2014devotional hearing is sacrifice, requiring genuine giving up of comfort to hear submissively.",

      "prompt": "18. How did the sages' meeting with Suta Gosvami occur according to SB 1.1.22?",
      "choices": [
        "Through their own careful planning and invitation",
        "By random accident with no higher purpose",
        "Because Suta needed money and they paid him",
        "By the will of providence (divine arrangement)"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "feedback": "Correct. They recognize divine arrangement, not taking credit. This guards against both presumption (thinking we can force association with advanced devotees) and despair. Sincere seeking attracts providential help. The verse encourages humble dependence on Krishna's mercy while seriously pursuing sadhu-sanga.",

      "choices": [
        "Dharma is a living principle requiring personal shelter\u2014in the Lord or His representatives",
        "Dharma disappeared when Krishna left",
        "Dharma exists independently of any personality",
        "Dharma is just abstract rules needing no person"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "Correct. Dharma isn't mere rule-following but a living principle requiring living shelter. When the Supreme Person is present, dharma flourishes; when He departs, it takes shelter in the Bhagavatam and pure devotees. This challenges legalistic religion, insisting dharma ultimately depends on persons, not just codes.",

Multiple verses establish this descending path: knowledge imparted to Brahma (1.1.1), submissive hearing (1.1.2), proper guidance (1.1.6), submissiveness to guru (1.1.8), teachings from acaryas (1.1.13). This opposes modern education's ascending approach of starting with doubt and independent analysis. For transcendental subject matter, the Absolute must reveal Himself through authorized channels; He cannot be forced to reveal Himself to hostile inquiry.",
