    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-01",
      "prompt": "In SB 1.1.1, what is the epistemological significance of how Vedic knowledge was transmitted to Brahma?",
      "choices": [
        "It proves knowledge can be discovered through empirical observation",
        "It establishes that transcendental knowledge descends from the Supreme, not from material intelligence",
        "It shows that ancient people were more intelligent",
        "It demonstrates that meditation alone is sufficient for knowledge"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse establishes that Lord Krishna imparted knowledge into Brahma's heart, proving that transcendental truth descends from above rather than being discovered through human speculation or material intelligence. This is the foundation of Vedic epistemology.",

    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-02",
      "prompt": "According to SB 1.1.1, even great sages and demigods can be bewildered by illusion. What does this teach us?",
      "choices": [
        "That intelligence alone cannot guarantee spiritual understanding",
        "That demigods are not very powerful",
        "That we should not study philosophy",
        "That material knowledge is superior to spiritual knowledge"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "This verse humbles us by showing that even highly intelligent beings can be bewildered without Krishna's mercy. Intellectual prowess alone cannot penetrate maya; we must approach spiritual truth with humility and reliance on revelation.",

    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-03",
      "prompt": "What type of religiosity does SB 1.1.2 completely reject using the term 'projjhita-kaitava'?",
      "choices": [
        "All organized religion",
        "Religious activities motivated by material desires (wealth, pleasure, or liberation as escape)",
        "Only violent religious practices",
        "Foreign religious traditions"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The Bhagavatam rejects religiosity performed for material gain, sense gratification, or even liberation conceived as escape. Only unmotivated devotional service satisfies the authentic spiritual need of the self.",

    {
      "id": "sb1-1-teens-04",
      "prompt": "Why does SB 1.1.2 specify that only the 'nirmatsaranam' (nonenvious) can understand the highest truth?",
      "choices": [
        "Because envious people are not intelligent enough",
        "Because envy creates a distorting lens that prevents accepting God's supremacy",
        "Because nonenvious people have better education",
        "Because envious people are too busy competing"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Envy is not just a moral flaw—it's an epistemological barrier. Material envy makes us unable to accept anyone's supremacy, including God's. Purity of heart, not intellectual credentials, qualifies one to understand transcendental truth.",

      "choices": [
        "One gains material prosperity",
        "The Supreme Lord becomes established within the heart",
        "One's sins are transferred to others",
        "One develops mystic powers"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Attentive and submissive hearing establishes the Supreme Lord in one's heart. Notice the epistemological emphasis: 'submissively' means receiving with humility, not analyzing with pride or skepticism.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-06",
      "prompt": "SB 1.1.3 describes the Bhagavatam as the 'mature fruit' from the lips of Sukadeva Gosvami. Why does this matter?",
      "choices": [
        "It's just poetic language with no deeper meaning",
        "It emphasizes that scripture must be received through parampara, not independently studied",
        "It means the Bhagavatam is only for renunciants",
        "It suggests the book should only be chanted, not read"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The 'lips of Sukadeva' imagery stresses that scripture gains potency through guru-parampara. Self-study without proper guidance is incomplete, even with genuine scripture.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-07",
      "prompt": "The sages assembled in Naimisaranya forest (SB 1.1.4) to perform a thousand-year sacrifice. What does this setting emphasize?",
      "choices": [
        "That spiritual life requires extreme isolation from society",
        "That serious spiritual inquiry requires dedication and proper association in a holy place",
        "That only ancient people were spiritual",
        "That modern life is incompatible with spirituality"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The narrative detail of a holy place, long-term commitment, and assembly of sages establishes that spiritual understanding requires proper environment, patience, and association—not casual or independent approaches.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-08",
      "prompt": "Why do the sages praise Suta Gosvami's qualifications (SB 1.1.6-8) before asking questions?",
      "choices": [
        "They are flattering him to get better answers",
        "They are establishing the principle that knowledge must come from a qualified source who has heard submissively",
        "They are showing off their own knowledge",
        "This is just cultural politeness without deeper meaning"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The detailed description of Suta's qualifications teaches epistemology: he learned submissively under proper guidance and can therefore transmit knowledge. This contrasts with self-appointed experts or speculative philosophers.",

      "prompt": "In SB 1.1.10, what specific characteristics define people in Kali-yuga?",
      "choices": [
        "They are peaceful, wise, and long-lived",
        "They have short lives, are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky, and always disturbed",
        "They are powerful warriors",
        "They have no interest in spiritual life whatsoever"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse precisely diagnoses Kali-yuga's symptoms, which include both external circumstances (short lives, bad luck) and internal disorders (quarrelsomeness, laziness, delusion). This realism prepares us to understand why the Bhagavatam's condensed, pure message is essential.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-10",
      "prompt": "Why do the sages ask Suta to 'select the essence' of all scriptures (SB 1.1.11)?",
      "choices": [
        "Because they are intellectually lazy",
        "Because in Kali-yuga, people lack time and clarity to study everything, so concentrated truth is needed",
        "Because most scriptures are false",
        "Because modern people are less intelligent"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "This is not laziness but wisdom. The sages recognize that Kali-yuga conditions demand concentrated, essential teachings. The request honors both the vastness of Vedic literature and the urgent practical need of suffering humanity.",

      "prompt": "According to SB 1.1.13, what is the purpose of hearing about Krishna's incarnations from acaryas?",
      "choices": [
        "To gain material blessings",
        "To pass exams on scripture",
        "One is uplifted both by speaking and hearing these teachings",
        "To impress others with knowledge"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Both speaker and hearer benefit, emphasizing that bhakti-yoga is inherently enlivening to the self. This is distinct from material education, which drains the student while rewarding the institution.",

        "That intention doesn't matter in spiritual life",
        "The transcendental potency of the holy name works beyond material consciousness or deliberate effort",
        "That we should chant without thinking",
        "That knowledge is unnecessary"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The holy name possesses inherent spiritual potency that transcends our mental state. While conscious chanting is superior, even inadvertent chanting has power—a radical claim that distinguishes bhakti from karma, which requires conscious intention.",

      "prompt": "Why can great devotees purify immediately, whereas holy rivers like Ganges require prolonged contact (SB 1.1.15)?",
      "choices": [
        "Because rivers are not actually holy",
        "Because devotees carry the Lord in their hearts, making them more potent than physical holy places",
        "Because physical contact with devotees is stronger than water",
        "Because rivers only work for Indian people"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Devotees are 'moving temples' carrying Krishna in their hearts, making them more powerful than stationary holy places. This challenges our tendency to value physical locations over living persons.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-14",
      "prompt": "In SB 1.1.19, why do those with transcendental relationships never tire of hearing Krishna's pastimes?",
      "choices": [
        "Because the pastimes are entertaining fiction",
        "Because developed spiritual taste (rasa) creates inexhaustible relish, unlike material pleasure which satiates",
        "Because they have no other hobbies",
        "Because social pressure forces them to pretend interest"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Transcendental rasa (spiritual taste) differs fundamentally from material pleasure. Material enjoyment brings satiation and boredom; spiritual relish increases with repetition. This verse describes experiential evidence of the soul's nature.",

      "id": "sb1-1-teens-15",
      "prompt": "In SB 1.1.20, why does the verse mention that Krishna 'played like a human being' while performing superhuman acts?",
      "choices": [
        "To show Krishna was pretending to be human",
        "To establish Krishna's simultaneous accessibility and transcendence—He appears human to attract us but remains supreme",
        "To prove Krishna was not actually God",
        "To show that all humans can perform miracles"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krishna's human-like pastimes make Him approachable without diminishing His divinity. This paradox—full accessibility and full supremacy—is unique to bhakti theology and enables loving relationships with the Absolute.",

      "choices": [
        "To escape from the world",
        "To perform sacrifice as defense against Kali-yuga's degradation by hearing transcendental messages at length",
        "To complain about modern times",
        "To preserve cultural traditions"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The sages responded to Kali-yuga strategically, not sentimentally. Hearing the transcendental message at length is presented as a 'sacrifice' and active spiritual defense, not passive nostalgia or escapism.",

      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/1/21/"

      "choices": [
        "That spiritual life is easy if you find the right person",
        "That navigating Kali-yuga's dangers requires expert guidance, not independent navigation",
        "That we should live on boats",
        "That only certain people can practice spirituality"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The ocean metaphor emphasizes danger and the necessity of an expert navigator. Self-directed spirituality is like attempting to cross an ocean without a captain—confident perhaps, but ultimately fatal.",

        "Religious principles no longer exist",
        "In ancient buildings and monuments"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Religious principles reside in living succession, not dead institutions. This verse anticipates the entire Bhagavatam's teaching that Krishna remains accessible through His representatives in guru-parampara.",

      "prompt": "Why does the first chapter emphasize Suta Gosvami's submissiveness to his spiritual masters (SB 1.1.8)?",
      "choices": [
        "To show that personality doesn't matter in spiritual life",
        "To establish that knowledge transmission requires receptivity, not rebellious independence",
        "To encourage blind following without questions",
        "To prove that intellectual inquiry is forbidden"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Submissiveness here means receptive humility, not intellectual suicide. Suta could teach because he learned to receive properly. This challenges modern education's emphasis on critical skepticism as the primary intellectual virtue.",

      "prompt": "Synthesizing Chapter 1: Why does the chapter spend so much time establishing the setting, speakers' qualifications, and Kali-yuga context before answering spiritual questions?",
      "choices": [
        "To fill space because the actual teachings are brief",
        "To demonstrate that proper epistemology (how we know) is as crucial as content (what we know)",
        "To show respect to ancient culture",
        "Because the narrative details are more important than philosophy"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Chapter 1's elaborate framing teaches that spiritual knowledge requires proper transmission: qualified speaker, receptive audience, holy place, urgent necessity. Content without proper epistemological context becomes mere information, not transformative revelation. This combats both fundamentalism (content without understanding) and relativism (no authoritative source).",

PRE-PUBLISH SELF-CHECK:
✓ Tier 1: 20 questions, all verses linked, teen-appropriate (more sophisticated but still accessible)
✓ Tier 2: 25% epistemology (Q1, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8, Q19 = 6/20 = 30% exceeds target), 6 purport-reasoning questions (Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8, Q14, Q20), narrative anchoring present (Naimisaranya setting, Suta's qualifications, sages' request), false-path distractors throughout (speculation vs hearing, independent study vs parampara, material motives), bhakti supremacy framing (pure devotion distinguished from motivated religiosity), feedback 2-3 sentences with philosophical depth
✓ Tier 3: End synthesis question Q20 integrates epistemology, authority, and purpose; progressive difficulty evident; plausible distractors (not silly)
