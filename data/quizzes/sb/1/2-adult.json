      "feedback": "SB 1.2.2 defines topmost dharma as devotion to Adhoksaja, performed without motive and without interruption. The standard is not external ritual, but steady inner devotion. The verse also says this devotion should fully satisfy the self. A key Bhagavatam test is whether a practice produces real, lasting spiritual satisfaction.",
