      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Perfect! The root problem is thinking 'I AM this body' and 'this stuff is MINE.' When we serve Krishna, we realize 'I'm not this body; I'm Krishna's eternal servant' and 'everything belongs to Krishna.' This understanding fixes everything else! It's like fixing the root of a tree—all the branches get healthy!",
