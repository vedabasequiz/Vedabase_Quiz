Expected Q Count: 15
Actual Q Count: 15 ✓

Vedabase-only sources: PASS ✓
All content from SB 1.2 verses and Prabhupada purports

Epistemology coverage: PASS ✓
Q1 (guru qualification: can cure, not just knows books), Q4 (hearing from authority vs. independent discovery), Q9 (learning from realized teacher vs. books alone), Q10 (faith as prerequisite for hearing)
= 4 of 15 = 27% exceeds 20-25% target ✓

Purport-reasoning coverage: PASS ✓
Q1 (guru cures material disease), Q2 (gradual purification), Q6 (causeless devotion), Q9 (realized vs. academic teacher), Q13 (positive path of attraction vs. negative renunciation)
= 5 questions, exceeds 4-5 requirement for kids ✓

False-path detection included: PASS ✓
Q1 (academic credentials vs. therapeutic effectiveness)
Q3 (rule-following vs. love-based dharma)
Q4 (independent practice vs. authorized guidance)
Q6 (motivated religion vs. pure devotion)
Q13 (forced renunciation vs. natural detachment through higher taste)

Difficulty progression: PASS ✓
First 60% (Q1-9): Foundational concepts about guru, hearing, gradual purification, dharma, three features of Absolute
Last 40% (Q10-15): Deeper integration—faith, Krishna in heart, progressive purification, synthesis of path, body's purpose, root illusion

End synthesis present: PASS ✓
Q15 asks about the root misconception (false identification with body) that devotional service cures, integrating epistemology (knowledge comes from outside) with ontology (I am not this body) and therapeutic efficacy (bhakti solves the root problem)

Final polish completed: PASS ✓
- All feedback 1-2 sentences, simple language, concrete examples kids relate to
- All verse URLs properly formatted
- IDs follow convention (sb1-2-kids-01, etc.)
