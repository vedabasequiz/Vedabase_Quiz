    {
      "id": "sb1-2-teens-01",
      "prompt": "1. According to SB 1.2.2, what is the ultimate test of a genuine spiritual master?",
      "choices": [
        "Possessing impressive academic credentials",
        "Having the ability to cure disciples of material disease (lust, anger, greed)",
        "Belonging to a recognized institutional lineage only",
        "Performing miracles and supernatural feats"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. A guru may have scriptural knowledge and institutional affiliation, but if unable to guide disciples toward heart purification, the knowledge is ineffective. This sets an empirical standard: can the guru actually cure the disciple's material disease? It guards against mistaking credentials or charisma for authentic spiritual authority.",

      "id": "sb1-2-teens-02",
      "prompt": "2. What is the gradual process described in SB 1.2.3 regarding continuous hearing about Vaasudeva?",
      "choices": [
        "Instant complete transformation occurs",
        "Devotional service establishes in the heart and material desires proportionately diminish",
        "Nothing changes unless accompanied by severe austerity",
        "One becomes immediately liberated"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. The process is gradual and proportionate—like a patient recovering under medical treatment. Continuous application of the remedy (hearing) brings progressive cure. This medical realism prevents both unrealistic expectations of instant transformation and cynical dismissal of the process. Consistent application guarantees efficacy.",

      "prompt": "3. SB 1.2.6 defines the highest dharma as that which leads to what?",
      "choices": [
        "Material prosperity and social respect",
        "Pure, causeless, uninterrupted devotional service (ahaituki apratihatā bhakti)",
        "Impersonal liberation from all activity",
        "Perfect varna-ashrama execution"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. The qualifiers 'ahaituki' (causeless/unmotivated) and 'apratihatā' (uninterrupted) are crucial. Activities not leading to transcendental loving service are considered inferior, even if executed perfectly by scriptural standards. This redefines dharma: the criterion is whether it cultivates bhakti, not merely external compliance with rules.",

      "choices": [
        "Renounce all work and retire to seclusion",
        "Inquire about the Absolute Truth submissively from one who knows",
        "Study all philosophical systems comparatively",
        "Perform elaborate Vedic rituals daily"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. This establishes epistemological exclusivity—inquiry about the Absolute Truth is not optional but the only truly necessary engagement. The verse challenges the assumption that balanced life requires multiple pursuits. From the perspective of actual self-interest, only inquiry into the Absolute Truth is non-optional; everything else is instrumental or distraction.",

      "choices": [
        "Wealth, fame, and power",
        "The knot of false ego is cut, doubts are cleared, karma is nullified",
        "Health, happiness, and wisdom",
        "Mystic powers, long life, and influence"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. These three are interconnected: false ego (root disease) creates doubt (cognitive manifestation), and both perpetuate karma (action-reaction chains). This is not symptom management but complete cure—dissolution of false identity, epistemic certainty through realized knowledge, and liberation from karmic bondage. No material process offers this comprehensive transformation.",

      "id": "sb1-2-teens-06",
      "prompt": "6. What does 'ahaituki' (unmotivated) devotional service mean in SB 1.2.9?",
      "choices": [
        "Lazy, irregular practice without discipline",
        "Service free from material motives—neither seeking gain, pleasure, liberation, nor personal return",
        "Service performed accidentally without intention",
        "Having no particular feelings about serving"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. This exposes sophisticated forms of selfishness disguised as spirituality. Many approach God for benefits or even liberation (refined sense gratification—ending suffering for oneself). Pure bhakti transcends all calculations, serving exclusively for the Lord's pleasure. This is the litmus test distinguishing authentic devotion from spiritualized self-interest.",

      "id": "sb1-2-teens-07",
      "prompt": "7. Why does rendering service to Krishna satisfy all desires (SB 1.2.10)?",
      "choices": [
        "Krishna grants whatever we want materially",
        "The living entity is constitutionally a servant; serving Krishna satisfies the self",
        "Devotional service suppresses desires through willpower",
        "Krishna hypnotizes devotees into thinking they're satisfied"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. This is a crucial ontological teaching: desires aren't the problem; misdirected service is. The soul is constitutionally a servant—when serving the Lord, it's satisfied; when serving matter, it remains frustrated. The solution isn't indulgence or extinction of desires, but redirection: engage the desire nature in devotional service for natural satisfaction.",

      "id": "sb1-2-teens-08",
      "prompt": "8. What is the complete meaning of 'dharma' according to SB 1.2.11?",
      "choices": [
        "Ethical behavior based on social consensus",
        "That which describes the eternal relationship with and service to the Lord (bhagavat-dharma)",
        "One's occupational duty in society",
        "Religious rules passed down through tradition"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Dharma's essence is relational—reconnecting the living entity with its source. While most religious systems focus on ethical codes or rituals, the Bhagavatam insists dharma involves sambandha (relationship) with Bhagavan. Rules and rituals are instrumental; the relationship is fundamental. This shifts the paradigm from duty-based to love-based religion.",

      "choices": [
        "Any professional teacher with academic qualifications",
        "One who has seen the truth face to face (tattva-darsi)",
        "Popular spiritual influencers with many followers",
        "Scholars who have studied multiple traditions"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Transcendental knowledge requires a realized teacher, not merely an informed one. Book learning and logic alone cannot convey realization. This guards against mistaking academic qualification for spiritual authority. University degrees in religious studies don't qualify one without personal realization, while a realized soul may lack formal education yet transmit authentic knowledge through direct vision.",

      "id": "sb1-2-teens-10",
      "prompt": "10. SB 1.2.13 describes the Absolute Truth in three features. What are they?",
      "choices": [
        "Body, mind, and soul",
        "Brahman (impersonal), Paramatma (Supersoul), and Bhagavan (Supreme Person)",
        "Creation, maintenance, and destruction",
        "Past, present, and future"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. These aren't three separate truths but three features of the One Absolute Truth, realized according to the level of the knower. This resolves apparent contradictions in scripture. Different schools emphasize different features, but complete vision sees all three as aspects of one reality, with Bhagavan as the complete realization including the other two.",

      "verseUrl": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/2/13/"

      "prompt": "11. Which realization of the Absolute Truth is most complete according to the purport of SB 1.2.13?",
      "choices": [
        "Brahman, as it encompasses everything equally",
        "Paramatma, as it's present in all hearts",
        "Bhagavan, as it includes Brahman and Paramatma features",
        "All three are equally complete with no hierarchy"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "feedback": "Correct. Brahman is preliminary, Paramatma is intermediate, and Bhagavan is complete understanding. Those realizing Bhagavan automatically realize the other two, but not vice versa. This isn't sectarianism but graduated comprehension. Impersonalists realize only effulgence, yogis the indwelling witness, but devotees realize the source of both—the Personality possessing all-pervading energy and localized presence.",

      "prompt": "12. What is the primary qualification for hearing transcendental narrations according to SB 1.2.17?",
      "choices": [
        "Superior intellectual capacity and education",
        "A faithful heart (sraddha-anvita)",
        "Complete material renunciation first",
        "Birth in an elevated family"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Faith (sraddha) is the basic qualification, more fundamental than intelligence, birth, or renunciation. Faith isn't blind acceptance but a predisposition of trust toward transcendental subject matter. Modern epistemology often opposes faith and reason, but the Bhagavatam makes faith the precondition for understanding. Transcendental truth can't be forced open by hostile skepticism; it requires provisional trust maturing into realized knowledge.",

      "prompt": "13. What happens when a faithful devotee regularly hears about Krishna (SB 1.2.18)?",
      "choices": [
        "The devotee develops intellectual understanding only",
        "Krishna becomes seated in the heart and cuts through material desires and doubts",
        "Nothing special without accompanying rituals",
        "The devotee gains temporary emotional satisfaction"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. This reveals the essential asymmetry of bhakti: the devotee makes small effort (faithful hearing), and Krishna reciprocates disproportionately (internal purification). Krishna's heart-presence isn't metaphorical but literal spiritual fact, manifesting as internal guidance and purification. This guards against both false independence (self-purification) and false despair (being too fallen for purification).",

      "choices": [
        "Complete transcendence of all material modes immediately",
        "Freedom from rajas and tamas, becoming fixed in sattva-guna",
        "Remaining in ignorance but with devotional feelings",
        "Bypassing goodness entirely to pure devotion"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. This is progressive purification, not instant transcendence—eliminating gross passion and ignorance first, stabilizing in goodness. This realistic roadmap prevents both complacency and discouragement. Beginners aren't immediately free from conditioning but experience progressive purification. From sattva-guna, further purification leads to transcendental goodness (suddha-sattva).",

      "prompt": "15. When situated in transcendental goodness, what realization occurs according to SB 1.2.20?",
      "choices": [
        "One merges into impersonal Brahman",
        "One realizes personal identity as eternal servant and the Lord as eternal master",
        "One becomes equal to God",
        "All distinctions between self and Supreme disappear"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Self-realization pairs with God-realization—not merger but relational understanding. One understands both constitutional positions (eternal servant/eternal master). This double realization produces lasting happiness by resolving ontological confusion. The Bhagavatam insists on both: knowing oneself as qualitatively one yet quantitatively different from God, establishing personalistic theistic non-dualism.",

      "choices": [
        "Past, present, and future suffering",
        "Adhyatmika (body/mind), adhibhautika (other beings), adhidaivika (natural disturbances)",
        "Physical pain, emotional suffering, and spiritual ignorance",
        "Poverty, disease, and old age"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Bhakti addresses the root of all suffering—separation from Krishna—thus eliminating derivative sufferings. The Bhagavatam doesn't promise elimination of external difficulties, but elimination of the suffering they cause. The devotee in Krishna consciousness transcends lamentation and fear because the self is understood as eternal. External circumstances lose power to create existential suffering. This is liberation within life.",

        "Mystic powers and supernatural abilities",
        "Scientific knowledge (tattva-jnanam) of the self and Absolute",
        "Material prosperity and good fortune",
        "Emotional bliss without understanding"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. The term 'scientific' indicates precise, verifiable understanding, not vague mysticism. This guards against reducing bhakti to sentimentalism. Authentic devotion produces systematic, reproducible knowledge of reality. The Bhagavatam refuses the false dichotomy between devotional feeling and philosophical understanding. Mature bhakti unites both—heart and head simultaneously engaged and satisfied.",

      "prompt": "18. What relationship does the Supersoul have with the individual soul according to SB 1.2.23?",
      "choices": [
        "They are completely identical without any distinction",
        "Qualitatively similar yet quantitatively different—a companion who is superior",
        "The Supersoul is an illusion created by ignorance",
        "No relationship exists; they're entirely separate"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Both are qualitatively one (spiritual) but quantitatively different in power and position. This is acintya-bhedabheda-tattva—inconceivable simultaneous oneness and difference. This navigates between absolute monism (denying real distinction) and dualism (denying unity). Qualitative oneness allows loving exchange; quantitative difference maintains devotional posture, preventing hubris.",

        "Detachment, then knowledge, then attachment, then liberation",
        "Hearing, attachment to Krishna, liberation from hankering, detachment from matter",
        "Renunciation, austerity, meditation, realization",
        "Knowledge, detachment, liberation, then devotion"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. One doesn't first become detached then approach Krishna; rather, attachment to Krishna automatically produces detachment from matter. This is bhakti's positive path versus jnana's negative path. Many paths demand renunciation as prerequisite, but the Bhagavatam reverses this: cultivate attachment to Krishna through hearing, and detachment follows naturally. Psychologically realistic: forced renunciation creates repression; spontaneous detachment through higher taste creates genuine freedom.",

      "choices": [
        "Bhakti is easiest and requires minimal effort",
        "Bhakti alone satisfies the self, grants complete knowledge, and liberates naturally through attraction to Krishna",
        "Bhakti leads to the most material benefit",
        "Bhakti is the oldest and most traditional path"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Correct. Bhakti's supremacy rests on three integrated points: (1) It satisfies the self's constitutional need to serve (the soul is by nature a servant). (2) It grants complete knowledge—Bhagavan realization, not just Brahman or Paramatma—including scientific knowledge of self and Absolute. (3) It liberates naturally through attraction, solving the practical problem of the heart's need for engagement. Karma can't satisfy (temporary), jnana can't fully know (stops at Brahman), yoga is difficult (requires withdrawal). Bhakti integrates satisfaction, knowledge, and liberation in a single accessible process—hearing and chanting with faith—appropriate for Kali-yuga.",
