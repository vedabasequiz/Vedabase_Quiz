      "prompt": "According to SB 1.2.2, what is the ultimate test of a bona fide spiritual master?",
      "choices": [
        "He possesses academic degrees in theology",
        "He can cure the disciple of material disease (lust, anger, greed)",
        "He belongs to an ancient lineage only",
        "He performs spectacular miracles"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse establishes a therapeutic criterion: the guru must cure the disciple's material disease. This guards against mistaking credentials, charisma, or institutional position for authentic spiritual authority.",

      "prompt": "What happens when a devotee continuously hears about Vasudeva (SB 1.2.3)?",
      "choices": [
        "Instant liberation occurs",
        "Bhakti is established in the heart and material desires diminish proportionately",
        "Nothing happens without severe austerities",
        "Only intellectual knowledge increases"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse presents gradual, proportionate purification through continuous hearing. This realistic medical model prevents both magical expectations and cynical dismissal of the process.",

      "choices": [
        "Perfect execution of varna-ashrama duties regardless of intent",
        "That which leads to causeless, uninterrupted devotional service to the transcendent Lord",
        "Renunciation of all activities",
        "Following one's cultural traditions faithfully"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Dharma is redefined not as rule-compliance but by its outcome: does it cultivate bhakti? This revolutionary criterion judges activities by their fruit (devotional transformation), not their form (ritual correctness).",

        "Studying comparative philosophy independently",
        "Accumulating merit through charity"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse establishes epistemological exclusivity—inquiry into the Absolute Truth is not optional but the only truly necessary engagement. This challenges the modern assumption of 'balanced' life with spirituality as one component among many.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse presents comprehensive cure: (1) false identification dissolved, (2) epistemic certainty through realization, (3) liberation from action-reaction. This is ontological transformation, not symptom management.",

        "Service without any particular goal"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Ahaituki means causeless—not seeking economic gain, pleasure, powers, or liberation. Even desire for liberation can be refined selfishness. Pure bhakti transcends all calculations, serving for the Lord's pleasure alone.",

      "id": "sb1-2-teens-07",
      "prompt": "How does SB 1.2.10 resolve the paradox of desire?",
      "choices": [
        "By eliminating all desires through force",
        "By redirecting desire to Krishna's service, which satisfies the self's constitutional need",
        "By moderating desires to reasonable levels",
        "By accepting that desires can never be satisfied"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse teaches that desires are satisfied not by fulfillment or suppression, but by correct direction. The living entity is constitutionally a servant; serving Krishna satisfies the self because it engages us in our natural function.",

      "id": "sb1-2-teens-08",

        "Creator, Maintainer, and Destroyer",
        "Body, Mind, and Spirit",
        "Past, Present, and Future"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "feedback": "The famous verse establishes three features of the nondual Absolute: Brahman (impersonal all-pervading), Paramatma (localized Supersoul), and Bhagavan (Supreme Personality). These are progressive realizations of one truth, not three separate entities.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.2.11",

    {
      "id": "sb1-2-teens-09",
      "prompt": "Why does the purport to SB 1.2.11 establish Bhagavan realization as most complete?",
      "choices": [
        "Because it is the easiest path",
        "Because realizing the personal feature includes understanding the impersonal and localized features",
        "Because it is more traditional",
        "Because it requires less philosophical understanding"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "One who realizes Bhagavan automatically understands Brahman and Paramatma, but not vice versa. This establishes hierarchy of completeness, not mere difference. Knowing the sun includes knowing sunshine and its localized presence.",

        "From academic scholars of religious studies",
        "From a tattva-darsi—one who has seen the truth, not merely studied it",
        "From popular spiritual influencers",
        "From anyone who speaks eloquently about philosophy"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse insists on learning from one who has realized the truth (tattva-darsi), not merely collected information. Book learning without realization cannot transmit transcendental knowledge. This distinguishes spiritual authority from academic credentials.",

        "A faithful heart (sraddha-anvita)",
        "Complete material renunciation first",
        "Birth in a spiritual family"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Sraddha (faith) is the foundational qualification, more essential than intelligence, birth, or renunciation. Faith is not blind acceptance but trusting receptivity that allows transcendental truth to be received, not forced open by hostile skepticism.",

      "choices": [
        "He grants material blessings",
        "He becomes seated in the heart and cuts through material desires",
        "He tests the devotee with more suffering",
        "He remains distant and uninvolved"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Krishna personally enters the heart and performs purification. This reveals the essential asymmetry of bhakti: the devotee makes small effort (faithful hearing), Krishna reciprocates with disproportionate mercy (internal transformation). We can't self-purify, but sincere hearing invites divine intervention.",

        "Only external difficulties",
        "The need for spiritual practice"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse indicates progressive purification: first eliminating passion and ignorance, becoming steady in goodness. This is realistic staging, preventing both complacency (thinking one is already pure) and discouragement (expecting instant perfection).",

      "prompt": "In SB 1.2.20, what dual realization occurs for the devotee in transcendental goodness?",
      "choices": [
        "Realization of Brahman effulgence only",
        "Knowledge of the self as eternal servant and knowledge of the Supreme Lord",
        "Understanding of past and future lives",
        "Ability to perform miracles"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse presents both self-knowledge (eternal servant) and God-knowledge (eternal master) in clear relationship. This double realization produces lasting happiness because ontological confusion is resolved. Bhakti provides both terms of the equation.",
      "verseLabel": "SB 1.2.20",

        "All physical pain instantly",
        "The need to maintain the body"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Bhakti addresses the root of suffering—separation from Krishna—thus eliminating all derivative sufferings. External difficulties may occur, but they lose power to create existential anguish. This is liberation within life, not escape from circumstances.",

        "Poetic sentiments only"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse specifies 'scientific' (tattva-jnanam) knowledge—precise, verifiable understanding of reality. This guards against reducing bhakti to sentimentalism. Authentic devotion produces knowledge—clear, systematic understanding that satisfies both heart and intellect.",

        "Renunciation → austerity → knowledge → devotion",
        "Hearing → attachment to Krishna → liberation from hankering → detachment from matter",
        "Detachment → knowledge → hearing → attachment",
        "Rituals → philosophy → meditation → devotion"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The verse reverses the jnana path: first cultivate attachment to Krishna (through hearing), then detachment from matter follows naturally. This is the positive path of higher taste versus the negative path of forced renunciation. Psychologically realistic and accessible to all.",

      "prompt": "Why should the body be maintained, according to SB 1.2.26?",
      "choices": [
        "To maximize sense enjoyment",
        "For inquiry about the Absolute Truth and realizing one's relationship with the Supreme",
        "To achieve athletic excellence",
        "To accumulate wealth for descendants"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "The body's purpose is self-realization and understanding our relationship with Krishna. Even animals maintain bodies for eating, sleeping, mating, defending; human life must have a higher purpose. The body is neither the self nor to be abused, but a vehicle for spiritual inquiry.",

        "Incorrect philosophical theories",
        "Lack of scriptural knowledge"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Bhakti attacks the root illusion—false bodily identification and possessiveness. When one realizes 'I am not this body; I am eternal servant of Krishna,' all other misconceptions dissolve. Body and possessions are seen as Krishna's property held in trust, eliminating anxiety.",

      "choices": [
        "Because it is the easiest path requiring no effort",
        "Because it alone satisfies the self, grants complete knowledge, and liberates naturally through attraction rather than force",
        "Because it is more ancient and traditional",
        "Because other paths are completely invalid"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "feedback": "Bhakti's supremacy rests on integration: (1) it satisfies the self's constitutional need to serve, (2) it grants complete knowledge of Bhagavan (not just partial realizations), (3) it liberates through natural attraction to Krishna rather than forced renunciation. This addresses both philosophical necessity (what is true) and practical efficacy (what actually works for fallen souls in Kali-yuga). The synthesis question tests whether the student grasps the cumulative argument across epistemology, ontology, and soteriology.",
