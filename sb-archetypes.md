# Srimad Bhagavatam Chapter Archetypes (Guide)

## Purpose
- Prevent forced uniformity across 335 chapters
- Reduce philosophical drift and mapping friction
- Keep editorial expectations consistent without overloading the validator

Archetypes are editorial metadata:
- Recommended in quiz files as chapterArchetype
- Not enforced as FAIL conditions by the validator

## Archetype List

### 1) epistemology-heavy
**Definition:**
Chapter primarily establishes pramana, authority, hearing, qualification, and rejection of speculation.

**Emphasize:**
- authority chain, disciplic succession, qualification to speak/hear
- hearing as method; sound as purification
- explicit anti-speculation contrasts

**Avoid:**
- trivia; plot-first sequencing
- ethics-first framing as the primary axis

**Mapping guidance:**
- Purport questions naturally distributed throughout
- Synthesis often centers on authority + method + result

**Typical synthesis patterns:**
- "authority -> hearing -> purification -> realization"
- "reject cheating religion -> accept pure bhakti"

---

### 2) narrative-heavy
**Definition:**
Chapter is primarily story-driven, with philosophy conveyed through events and character behavior.

**Emphasize:**
- narrative-as-teaching (why the event is included)
- consequences of mindsets, decisions, and association
- the implicit philosophy made explicit via purport

**Avoid:**
- plot trivia (names/dates without meaning)
- abstract metaphysics disconnected from the story context

**Mapping guidance:**
- Keep purport ratio within 35-45% for Adults, but focus purports on interpreting meaning of events
- Synthesis should connect story lesson to SB epistemology and bhakti purpose

**Typical synthesis patterns:**
- "event -> lesson -> application to Kali-yuga"
- "association -> consciousness -> outcome"

---

### 3) mixed
**Definition:**
Balanced combination of narrative development and explicit philosophical exposition.

**Emphasize:**
- alternate between story grounding and philosophical interpretation
- maintain steady cadence (avoid clustering all philosophy at the end)

**Avoid:**
- abrupt tonal shifts
- repetitive "hearing is best" restatements without new angle

**Mapping guidance:**
- Purport questions should be spread evenly
- Include at least one narrative-as-teaching question and one authority/method question

**Typical synthesis patterns:**
- "method of hearing supports understanding of the narrative"
- "dharma purpose clarified through events"

---

### 4) genealogy
**Definition:**
Lists, lineages, dynasties, and transitions that can tempt trivia questions.

**Emphasize:**
- why lineage matters (continuity of dharma and authority)
- what the genealogy is meant to support in the narrative arc
- the teaching purpose, not memorization

**Avoid:**
- "who is the father of X" trivia unless purport frames its significance
- over-indexing on names without a philosophical point

**Mapping guidance:**
- Use translation questions sparingly and meaningfully
- Use purport questions to explain why genealogies are included
- Synthesis should unify continuity, authority, and the chapter’s placement

**Typical synthesis patterns:**
- "lineage -> legitimacy/authority -> transmission of dharma/bhakti"
- "continuity -> SB’s historical grounding"

---

### 5) theological-core
**Definition:**
Chapter centrally reveals or clarifies the nature of Bhagavan, bhakti, and transcendental conclusions.

**Emphasize:**
- clear theological claims grounded in translation and purport
- false-path detection (impersonalism, mixed devotion, moralism)
- devotional conclusions and their implications

**Avoid:**
- flattening theology into generic ethics
- over-technical metaphysics without SB framing

**Mapping guidance:**
- Purport questions often increase in density (still within 35-45% for Adults)
- End-section synthesis is essential and should feel conclusive

**Typical synthesis patterns:**
- "Bhagavan’s nature -> proper approach -> bhakti result"
- "reject false conclusions -> accept pure devotional conclusion"

## How to Use Archetypes in Practice
- Pick the archetype before mapping.
- Use it to decide:
  - where narrative grounding is needed
  - where purport reasoning must be explicit
  - what synthesis should consolidate
- Archetype informs editorial review, not validator failure.
