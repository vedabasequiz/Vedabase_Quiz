# Srimad Bhagavatam Question Templates (Canonical Shapes)

## Purpose
- Maintain consistent SB-native question patterns across hundreds of chapters
- Reduce writing fatigue and drift
- Improve clarity, distractor quality, and philosophical alignment

These are templates for question shapes, not content.

---

## A) Authority and Qualification Templates

**Speaker qualification**
- "In SB X.Y.Z, what qualifies [speaker] to present this knowledge?"
- Distractors: popularity, scholarship alone, wealth, political power

**Hearing qualification**
- "According to the purport to SB X.Y.Z, what attitude makes hearing effective?"
- Distractors: curiosity only, argument, skepticism as virtue, passive listening

**Disciplic succession**
- "Why does disciplic succession matter in establishing authority here?"
- Distractors: personal charisma, originality, majority opinion, modern logic

---

## B) Hearing vs Speculation Templates

**Method contrast**
- "Why is hearing emphasized over speculation in this context?"
- Distractors: speculation is faster, speculation is equal, hearing is optional, hearing is only cultural

**Sound purification**
- "What is the stated effect of attentive hearing on the heart?"
- Distractors: social benefit only, intellectual pride, temporary peace, ritual merit

**Non-equivalence contrast**
- "Why is hearing Srimad Bhagavatam not equivalent to general scripture study?"
- Distractors: language preference, popularity, cultural identity, entertainment value

---

## C) Kaitava-dharma and False-Path Detection Templates

**Cheating religion**
- "What is rejected as kaitava-dharma according to the purport?"
- Distractors: all rituals, all rules, all philosophy, all renunciation

**Mixed motives**
- "Which motive undermines the purity of religious practice in this explanation?"
- Distractors: service attitude, humility, desire to please Krishna, surrender

**Impersonal/misread conclusions**
- "Which misunderstanding does the purport warn against in interpreting this verse?"
- Distractors: personal devotion, surrender, service, hearing from authority

---

## D) Kali-yuga Diagnosis and Remedy Templates

**Kali-yuga condition**
- "Which condition of Kali-yuga is highlighted as a reason for this instruction?"
- Distractors: increased leisure, improved memory, universal truthfulness, stable dharma

**Remedy**
- "What remedy is emphasized for Kali-yuga in this context?"
- Distractors: complex rituals only, austere isolation, political reform, speculative meditation

---

## E) Narrative-as-Teaching Templates (Avoid Trivia)

**Why the event is included**
- "What teaching purpose does this event serve in the chapter?"
- Distractors: entertainment, historical curiosity only, irrelevant detail, political commentary

**Character as lesson**
- "What mindset is illustrated through this character’s behavior according to the purport?"
- Distractors: neutrality, pure devotion (when not), advanced renunciation, detached compassion (when not)

**Consequence mapping**
- "What consequence is emphasized as resulting from this attitude/association?"
- Distractors: immediate wealth, social fame, ritual merit, moral superiority

---

## F) Devotional Conclusion Templates (Theological Core)

**Pure bhakti definition**
- "What feature distinguishes pure devotional service here?"
- Distractors: motivated by gain, intermittent, mixed with jnana/karma as end, dependent on ritual

**Result of bhakti**
- "What result is described as naturally arising from devotional service?"
- Distractors: pride, argumentation skill, social status, material security

---

## G) Synthesis Templates (Use 3+ for Adults; 1+ in last 5)

Synthesis must be explicitly marked using tags: ["synthesis"] or type: "synthesis".

**Triad integration**
- "How do authority, hearing, and purification connect in this chapter’s logic?"
- Distractors: authority is optional, hearing is symbolic, purification is unrelated, results are accidental

**Contrastive synthesis**
- "Why does this chapter reject both fruitive work and dry speculation as final goals?"
- Distractors: both are identical to bhakti, both guarantee liberation, both are condemned as immoral, both are required ends

**End-of-chapter consolidation**
- "What misunderstanding of religion or spirituality does this chapter decisively remove?"
- Distractors: that devotion is sectarian only, that morality alone is sufficient, that speculation is the path, that bhakti is optional

## H) Practical Construction Notes (Applies to all templates)
- Keep choices roughly parallel in length and structure.
- Avoid very short distractors (<3 words) unless all are parallel.
- Do not make the correct option systematically longest.
- Ground correct answer in verse/purport intent (no cleverness).
- Feedback must include direct Vedabase verse URL.
- No verdict labels in feedback text.
